we
run
nights
,

laid
up

hid
daytimes
;
soon
as
night
was
most
gone
we
stopped
navigating
and
tied
up—nearly
always
in
the
dead
water
under
a

then
cut

woman
in
a
long
white
gown
,
standing
on
the
rail
of
a
bridge
all
ready
to
jump
off
,
with
her
hair
all
down
her
back
,
and
looking
up
to
the
moon
,
with
the
tears
running
down
her
face
,
and
she
had
two
arms
folded
across
her
breast
,
and
two
arms
stretched
out
in
front
,
and
two
more
reaching
up
towards
the
moon—and
the
idea
was
to
see
which
pair
would
look
best
,
and
then
scratch
out
all
the
other
arms
;
but
,
as
i
was
saying
,
she
died
before
she
got
her
mind
made
up
,
and
now
they
kept
this
picture
over
the
head
of
the
bed
in
her
room
,
and
every
time
her
birthday
come
they
hung
flowers
on
it

give
up
the
five
buildings

the
million
if
she
had
it—to
leave
that
devil

at
the

on

sounds

floated
in
from
the

whiffs
of

from

it

the
frost

intense

that
the

sun
was
lighting

its
chilly
rays
a
solitary
wayfarer
on
the
snowy

the

it’s
the

that
smooths

probably
ludicrous
and
grotesque
,
but
i
saw
nothing
humiliating
in
having
to
stand

it

bright
as

,
and
you’d
have
a
little
glimpse
of
tree-tops
a-plunging
about
away
off
yonder
in
the
storm
,
hundreds
of
yards
further
than
you
could
see
before
;
dark
as
sin
again
in
a
second
,
and
now
you’d
hear
the
thunder
let
go
with
an
awful
crash
,
and
then
go
rumbling
,
grumbling
,
tumbling
,
down
the
sky
towards
the
under
side
of
the
world
,
like
rolling
empty
barrels
down

it’s

|

on
the
third
day
,
i
think
,
of
his
being
with
me
,
and
before
any
necessity
had
arisen
for
having
his
own
writing
examined
,
that
,
being
much
hurried
to
complete
a
small
affair
i
had
in
hand
,
i
abruptly
called
to
bartleby
.

|
|
plain
that
it
involuntarily
rolled
from
his
tongue
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
truly
a
beautiful
thought
to
have
assumed
bartleby’s
departure
;
but
,
after
all
,
that
assumption
was
simply
my
own
,
and
none
of
bartleby’s
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

hardly
possible
that
bartleby
could
withstand
such
an
application
of
the
doctrine
of
assumptions
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

withdrawn
;
and
being
folded
up

left
him

solemn
,
drifting
down
the
big
,
still
river
,
laying
on
our
backs
looking
up
at
the
stars
,
and
we
didn’t
ever
feel
like
talking
loud
,
and
it
warn’t
often
that
we
laughed—only
a
little
kind
of

ornery
preaching—all
about
brotherly
love
,
and
such-like
tiresomeness
;
but
everybody
said
it
was
a
good
sermon
,
and
they
all
talked
it
over
going
home
,
and
had
such
a
powerful
lot
to
say
about
faith
and
good
works
and
free
grace
and
preforeordestination
,
and
i
don’t
know
what
all
,
that
it
did
seem

me
to
be
one

‘lection
day
,
and
i
was
just
about
to
go
and
vote
myself
if
i
warn’t
too
drunk
to
get
there
;
but
when
they
told
me
there
was
a
state
in
this
country
where
they’d
let
that
nigger
vote
,
i
drawed
out

now

we
went
right
on

tie
up

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
about
dark
now
;
so
i
dropped
the
canoe
down
the
river
under
some
willows
that
hung
over
the
bank
,
and
waited
for
the

to

slanting

i

fifteen
minutes
before
i
could
work
myself
up
to
go
and
humble
myself
to
a
nigger
;
but
i
done
it
,

i
warn’t

it

sometimes
when
one
of
these
peddlers
had
been
along
and
scoured
her
up

got
her
in

she

a
quite
ordinary

besides
,
petersburg

a

appearance

not

most
an
hour
yet
till
breakfast
,
so
we
left
and
struck
down
into
the
woods
;
because
tom
said
we
got
to
have
some
light
to
see
how
to
dig
by
,
and
a
lantern
makes
too
much
,
and
might
get
us
into
trouble
;
what
we
must
have
was
a
lot
of
them
rotten
chunks
that’s
called
fox-fire
,
and
just
makes
a
soft
kind
of
a
glow
when
you
lay
them
in

dark
place

get
so
dark
that
it
looked
all
blue-black
outside
,
and
lovely
;
and
the
rain
would
thrash
along
by
so
thick
that
the
trees
off
a
little
ways
looked
dim
and
spider-webby
;
and
here
would
come
a
blast
of
wind
that
would
bend
the
trees
down
and
turn
up
the
pale
underside
of
the
leaves
;
and
then
a
perfect
ripper
of
a
gust
would
follow
along
and
set
the
branches
to
tossing
their
arms
as
if
they
was
just
wild
;
and
next
,
when
it

just
about
the
bluest

from
ivan
karlovitch
the
gardener
;
and
another—not
the
real
one—who
seemed
as
though
he
were
half
drunk
,
would
interrupt
a
business
conversation
at
half
a
word
,
touch
the
gardener
on
the
shoulder
,
and
begin
muttering
:
"say
what
you
like
,
there
is
a
great
deal
in
blood

to
me
that
she

still

an

go
into
ecstasies
over

that
,
at
a
distance
,
for
the
past
month
,
he
had
heard
lions
roaring
,
and
smelled
their
strong
odor
seeping
as
far
away
as
his
study
door
.

like
he
was
just
born
for
it
;
and
when
he
had
his
hand
in
and
was
excited
,
it
was
perfectly
lovely
the
way
he
would
rip
and
tear
and
rair
up
behind
when

it
off

seems
to
me
that
i
have
no
illness
,
but
that
i
am
weary
and
frightened
,
because
it
is

to
be
so

no
one
has
ever
yet
written
of
love
truly
,
and
i
doubt
whether
this
tender
,
joyful
,
agonising
feeling
can
be
described
,
and
any
one
who
has
once
experienced
it
would
not
attempt

put
it

strange
to
me
that
from
morning

i
feel
nothing

joy

it

my

began
like
this
:
"the
frost
was
intense
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
usually
begins
with
the
soup
.
|
|
|
|
|
began
by
orlov's
speaking
with
laughing
eyes
of
some
acquaintance
,
of
some
book
he
had
lately
been
reading
,
of
a
new
appointment
or
government
scheme
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
must
be
confessed
our
tastes
are
very
different
,

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
as
he
orders
.
|

have
required
him
to
deal
with
extremely
small
wheels
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
been
close
on
to
one
o’clock
when
we
got
below
the
island
at
last
,
and
the
raft
did
seem
to
go
mighty
slow
.
|
|
|

|
take
‘em
a
week
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
grew
warm
.
|
|
|
occurred
to
him
that
if
this
strange
,
supernatural
monk
had
appeared
to
him
only
,
that
meant
that
he
was
ill
and
had
reached
the
point
of
having
hallucinations
.

|
struck
three
o'clock
.
|
|
|
|
moved
with
fearful
rapidity
across
the
bay
,
towards
the
hotel
,
growing
smaller
and
darker
as
it
came
,
and
kovrin
only
just
had
time
to
get
out
of
the
way
to
let
it
pass
.

|
|
also
seemed
to
him
that
nyuta
laughed
loudly
on
purpose
,
and
kept
glancing
in
his
direction
to
give
him
to
understand
that
the
memory
of
the
night
did
not
trouble
her
in
the
least
,
and
that
she
was
not
aware
of
the
presence
at
table
of
the
"ugly
duckling
.

appeared
that
the
maid
had
been
sent
out
somewhere
by
the
lady
of
the
house
.

responded
to
the
invitation

out

,
when
he
had
been
invited
to

the
execution
of

makes
me
miserable
to
see
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
feel
ridiculous
to
think
i
was
soft
enough
to
believe
that
rubbage

|
|
sometimes
happened
that
after
putting
on
his
dress
clothes
to
go
out
somewhere
,
and
after
saying
good-bye
to
zinaida
fyodorovna
,
he
would
suddenly
change
his
mind

remain
at

from
sheer
perversity

did
not
seem
in
keeping
with
her
genuine
grief
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lead
him
to
consider
his
weaknesses
as

creature
affected

curved
into

where
it
disappeared
behind
another
pine-covered

led

75

still
farther
on

a

knew
that
this
was
no
time
for
traveling
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
what
danger
,
but
somewhere
in
its
brain
arose
a
fear
of
the
man
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
the
form
of
ice
and
increased
with
every
warm
,
moist
breath
from
his
mouth
.

|
|

|
|

|
|
|
away
all
the
uncomfortableness
and
we
felt
mighty
good
over
it
,
because
it
would
a
been
a
miserable
business
to
have
any
unfriendliness
on
the
raft
;
for
what
you
want
,
above
all
things
,
on
a
raft
,
is
for
everybody
to
be
satisfied
,
and
feel
right
and
kind
towards
the
others
.

hesitated
until
the
man
pushed
it
forward
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
merely
obeyed
the
commands
that
arose
from
the
deepest
part
of
its
being
.
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|

flattened
its
ears
at
the
sound
of
the
man’s
voice
;
its
uneasy
movements
and
the
liftings
of
its
feet
became
more
noticeable
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

stopped
40
feet
away
and
observed
him
curiously
,
with
ears
sharply
bent
forward
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
told
him
that
it
was
too
many
miles
away
,
that
the
freezing
had
too
great
a
start
and
that
he
would
soon
be
dead
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

became
necessary
to
examine
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
rather
proceeds
from
a
certain
hopelessness
of
remedying
excessive
and
organic
ill
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

does
not
strike
me
that
there

any

me
that
the

had
sent
to

itself
automatically

good

early

because
i
overslept

|
|

quite
midnight
yet
,
so
we
cleared
out
for
the

leaving

rolled
about
an

kept
a-coming
,
and
when
it
was
abreast

me
i
see
there
warn’t
but
one
man
in
it
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

didn’t
take
me
long
to
get
there
.
|
|
|
make
up
my
mind
that
these
liars
warn’t
no
kings
nor
dukes
at
all
,
but
just
low-down
humbugs
and
frauds
.

killed

tom
said
;
it’s
his
right

and
so
,
as
long
as
we
was
representing
a
prisoner
,
we
had
a
perfect
right
to
steal
anything
on

it

i

it

out

there
ain’t

just
the

we

it
was

give

the

that

me
by

drunk

as
you

he
didn’t

nothing
at

the

he
woke
,
stricken
still
with
the
hours-old
vision
of
ascending
through
rose-lit
cumulus
,
of
houses
and
barns
like
specks
deep
in
the
snowed-in
valleys
,
all
the
scrolling
country
below
looking
december—brown
and
black
hills
streaked
with
snow
,
flashes
of
iced-over
lakes
,
the
long
braids

river
gleaming
at

past
the

of

to
the

stood
at
its
rim

|

|
|
up

down
,
and
loathed
the
grey
fence
more
and
more
,
and
by
now
he
thought
irritably
that
anna
sergeyevna
had
forgotten
him
,
and
was
perhaps
already
amusing
herself
with
some
one
else
,
and
that
that
was
very
natural
in
a
young
woman
who
had
nothing
to
look
at
from
morning
till
night
but
that
confounded
fence

|
|
|

in
a
leisurely
way
(he
had
not

set
up
his
carriage)
,
humming
all
the
time
:
"'before

for
half
a
mile
through
the
fields
;
the
cemetery
showed
as
a
dark
streak
in
the
distance
,
like
a
forest
or
a
big
garden

about

drawing-room
,
declaiming
some
congratulatory
verses

he

recited

|
|
|
|
|
|
three
times
up

down
the

grew
a

calmer
,

went
into
the
house
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
few
steps
,
stamping
his
feet
and
waving
his
arms
,
until
reassured
by
the
returning
warmth
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

back

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
never
felt
such
wind
;
it
had
him
pinned
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
like
that
himself
towards
any
woman
,
but
he
knew
that
such
a
feeling
must
be
love
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
his
life
taken
a
weapon
in
his
hand
before
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
it
would
be
like
a
hunt—like
waiting
hours
beside
a
wallow
with
his
rifle
barrel
on
his
pack
to
see
the
huge
antlered
head
of
a
bull
elk
loom
up
against
the
sky
,
to
hear
the
whole
herd
behind
him
inhale
and
then
scatter
down
the
hill
.

another
diversion
to
which
he
took
imperceptibly
,
little
by
little
:
in
the
evening
he
would
take
out
of
his
pockets
the
notes
he
had
gained
by
his
practice
,
and
sometimes
there
were
stuffed
in
his
pockets
notes—yellow
and
green
,
and
smelling
of
scent
and
vinegar
and
incense
and
fish
oil—up
to
the
value
of
seventy
roubles
;
and
when
they
amounted
to
some
hundreds
he
took
them
to
the
mutual
credit
bank
and
deposited
the
money
there
to
his
account

extremely

he
was

he

pulled
up
the

began
telling
some
long-winded

,
seeing
he

he
flung
the
rug

little

wounded—he

not

could
not

that
all
his
dreams

his
hopes

yearnings
,
had
led
him
up
to
such
a
stupid
end

just
as
in
some
little
play
at
an
amateur
performance
,

he
was
sorry
for
his
feeling
,
for
that
love
of
his
,
so
sorry
that
he
felt
as

back

he
had
happened
to
read
about
factories
,
and
had
been
in
the
houses
of
manufacturers
and
had
talked
to
them
;
and
whenever
he
saw
a
factory
far
or
near
,
he
always
thought
how
quiet
and
peaceable
it
was
outside
,
but
within
there
was
always
sure
to
be
impenetrable
ignorance
and
dull
egoism
on
the
side
of
the
owners
,
wearisome
,
unhealthy
toil
on
the
side
of
the
workpeople
,
squabbling
,
vermin
,
vodka

it
happened
two

there

ashamed
that
he
had
been
treated
like
a
small
boy
,
ashamed
of
his
shyness
,
and
,
most
of
all
,
that
he
had
had
the
audacity
to
put
his
arms
round
the
waist
of
a
respectable

,
as

him

he

also
had
some
post
in
a
bank
;
he
was
a
consulting
lawyer
in
some
important

had
business
relations
with
a
large
number

quite
a

peculiar
intelligence

able
to
multiply

in
his
head
instantaneously
,
or
turn
english
pounds
into
german
marks
without
help
of
pencil
or
paper
;
he
understood
finance
and
railway
business
thoroughly
,
and
the
machinery
of
russian
administration
had
no
secrets
for
him
;
he
was
a
most
skilful
pleader
in
civil
suits
,

it
was
not
easy
to
get
the
better
of
him
at

unfaithful
to
his

he
was
only
fond
of
his
children
when
he
saw
them
,
and
on
the
whole
was
rather
indifferent

regaled
with
tea

,
and
he
used
to
titter
and
,
anxious
to
say
something
pleasant
,
would
declare
that
a
free
union
was
superior
in
every
respect
to
legal
marriage
,
and
that
all
decent
people
ought
really
to
come

ill-humoured—first
,
because
the
room
was
taken
up
with
dancing
and
there
was
nowhere
he
could
play
a
game
of
cards
;
secondly
,
because
he
could
not
endure
the
sound
of
wind
instruments
;
and
,
thirdly
,
because
he
fancied
the
officers
treated
the
civilians
somewhat
too
casually
and
disdainfully
.

pleased
and
satisfied
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
the
lack
of
something
;
he
would
have
liked
to
go
back
to
the
club
and
make
every
one
feel
dreary
and
miserable
,
so
that
all
might
know
how
stale
and
worthless
life
is
when
you
walk
along
the
streets
in
the
dark
and
hear
the
slush
of
the
mud
under
your
feet
,
and
when
you
know
that
you
will
wake
up
next
morning
with
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
vodka
and
cards
.

certain

unusually
tired
,
breathing
with
his

just

kind
of
thing
was
right
in

laying

gone

he
got
back
to-day

i

him
as

here
two
hours

innocentest

best
old
soul
i
ever

saying
how
the
first
thing
he
would
do
when
he
got
to
a
free
state
he
would
go
to
saving
up
money
and
never
spend
a
single
cent
,
and
when
he
got
enough
he
would
buy
his
wife
,
which
was
owned
on
a
farm
close
to
where
miss
watson
lived
;
and
then
they
would
both
work
to
buy
the
two
children
,
and
if
their
master
wouldn’t
sell
them
,
they’d
get
an
ab’litionist
to
go
and
steal
them
.

awful
surprised
.
|
|
|
a-reeling
across
the
street
towards
me
,
bare-headed
,
with
a
friend
on
both
sides
of
him
a-holt
of
his
arms
and
hurrying
him
along
.

quiet
,
and
looked
uneasy
;
and
he
warn’t
hanging
back
any
,
but
was
doing
some
of
the
hurrying
himself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thinking
about
his
wife
and
his
children
,
away
up
yonder
,
and
he
was
low
and
homesick
;
because
he
hadn’t
ever
been
away
from
home
before
in
his
life
;
and
i
do
believe
he
cared
just
as
much
for
his
people
as
white
folks
does
for
their’n
.

uncommon
bright
,
the
duke
was
,
and
he
soon
struck
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
at
the
pint
that
mornin’
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sticking
up
a
bill
for
the
royal
nonesuch—three-night
performance—like
that
other
time
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
always
just
that
particular
.
|
|
|
|
|
so
glad
to
see
us
he
most
cried
;
and
called
us
honey
,
and
all
the
pet
names
he
could
think
of
;
and
was
for
having
us
hunt
up
a
cold-chisel
to
cut
the
chain
off
of
his
leg
with
right
away
,
and
clearing
out
without
losing
any
time
.

here
a
minute

.
|
|
|
|
|
|
rushed
to
the
stage
after
each
performance
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
searched
for
something
he
might
say
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
dug
down
three
feet
and
then
encountered
a
smooth
,
icy
crust
covering
a
large
hole
in
the
base
of
the
tree
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

shook
his
head
no
.
|
|
vigorously
,
briefly
looked
back
at
the
condemned
man
and
the
soldier
,
who
both
flinched
and
stopped
eating
the
rice
,
went
up
really
close
up
to
the
traveler
,
without
looking
into
his
face
,
but
gazing
at
parts
of
his
jacket
,
and
said
more
gently
than
before
:
“you
don’t
know
the
commandant

pulled
at
her
again
but
lost
his
footing
and
fell
back
,
clutching
an
empty
mitten
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
on
the
mitten
quickly
and
beat
the
hand
across
his
breast
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
mittens
with
his

,

began
swinging
his
arms

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
mitten
on
hurriedly
and
stood
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
from
his
right
hand
and
grasped
the
tree
bark
from
his
pocket

sword
out
of
its
scabbard
,
broke
it
in
pieces
,
gathered
up
everything—the
pieces
of
the
sword
,
the
scabbard
,
and
the
harness—and
threw
them
away
so
forcefully
that
they
rattled
against
each
other
down
in
the
pit
.

off

,
sweating
.

couldn't
remember

understand
them—one
of
them
wasn't
even
in
english
.
|
|
|
|
|

|

how
they

put
her
hands
on
the
bear
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

,
also
,
how
he
had
torn
up
his
dissertation
and
all
the
articles
he
had
written
during
his
illness
,
and
how
he
had
thrown
them
out
of
window
,
and
the
bits
of
paper
had
fluttered
in
the
wind
and
caught
on
the
trees
and
flowers

in

she
went
out
every
day

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
showed
her
a
thousand
ladybugs
hibernating
in
an
orange
ball
hung
in
a
riverbank
hollow
;
a
pair
of
dormant
frogs
buried
in

pried
a
globe
of
honeybees
from
its
hive
,
slow-buzzing
,
stunned
from
the
sudden
exposure

tightly
packed
around
the

sit
down

himself

gone

a
come

you’ve
missed
him
along
the
road
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
!
|
|
|
|
came
home
stinking
of
fish
guts
and
woke
her
with
eager
stories—native
trout
leaping
fifteen-foot
cataracts
,
a
stubborn
rainbow
wedged
under
a
snag
.

in
gaping
and
digging
one
fist
into
his
eyes

he
was
dragging
a

along
with
the
other
one

the

up

over
the
hinges

|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
grabbed
his
bow
and

and
dashed
out
into
the
snow
barefoot
,
his
feet
going
numb
.

rode
straight
to
the
place

we
was
hid

|
|
|
|

unbolted
what
was
left
of
the
door
and
swung
it
free
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
squatted
in
the
dark
entrance—their
only
exit—with
his
bow
at
full
draw
and
an
arrow
nocked
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

fire
arrows

"ladies
and
gentlemen
,
"it
has
fallen
to
my
lot
this
evening
,
as
in
years
past
,
to
perform
a
very
pleasing
task
but
a
task
for
which
i
am
afraid
my
poor
powers
as
a
speaker
are
all
too
inadequate

dry
grasses

the
tiniest
sticks
on
the
flame

waving
his
arms

beating
the
mittened
hands
against
his
sides
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
heard
some
bite
into
the
foundation
blocks
at
the
back
of
the
crawl
space
,
others
sink
into
flesh
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

a
whispering
in
the
entry
;
some
one
was
softly
snoring
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
spent
his
whole
quiver
:
a
dozen
arrows
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
felt
teeth
go
to
the
bone
of
his
arm

felt
hot
breath
on
his
cheeks
.

|
|

like
driving
his
fork
through
the
table
.

|
|
|
|
drawn
toward
the
pond
,
the
birdbath
,
the
hedges
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
quite
at
ease
now
for
he
was
an
expert
carver
and
liked
nothing
better
than
to
find
himself
at
the
head
of
a
well-laden
table

frightened

it
seemed
as

all
the
people
in
the
boxes

looking

compassion
for
this
life
,
still
so
warm

lovely
,

probably
already
not

from

to
fade

wither

all
the
sorrier
for
her
because
her
grief
was
not
a
serious
one
,
yet
she
suffered
extremely
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
insufferably
ashamed
,
so
much
so
that
he
wondered
that
human
shame
could
reach
such
a
pitch
of
acuteness
and
intensity
.

sorry
that
he
was
so
stupidly
going
away
,
and
he
was
by
now
persuaded
that
if
the
same
thing
happened
again
he
would
be
bolder
and
look
at
it
more
simply

suffocated
and
giddy
from
the
smell
of
ether
,
carbolic
acid
,
and
various
drugs
,
which
he
quite
unnecessarily
snatched
up
with
his
trembling
fingers

spilled
in
so
doing

this
and
was
so
intensely
miserable
that
one
of
the
passengers
,
after
looking
in
his
face
attentively
,
actually
asked
:

"ladies

,
the
generation
which
is
now
on
the
wane
among
us
may
have
had
its
faults
but
for
my
part
i
think
it
had
certain
qualities
of
hospitality
,
of
humour
,
of
humanity
,
which
the
new
and
very
serious
and
hypereducated
generation
that
is
growing
up
around
us
seems
to
me
to

about

a
long
time
about
his

remembering
it
all
and
smiling
;
then
his
memories
passed
into
dreams
,

in
his

the
past
was

with
what
was

come
.

o’clock

dipping
his

into
his

them

nothing
in
response
to
that
,
but
could
only
add
that
he
did
not
understand
what
he
was
doing
on
this
occasion
,
for
the
purpose
of
his
traveling
was
merely
to
observe
and
not

alter
other

down

offered
me
a
cigar
,
and
with
a
delicacy
only
found
in
well-bred
people
,
concealing
the
unpleasant
feeling
aroused
by
my
face

my
wasted
figure
,
observed
casually
that
i

spilled
his

;
in
mending
his
pens
,
impatiently
split
them
all
to
pieces
,
and
threw
them
on
the
floor
in
a
sudden
passion
;
stood
up
and
leaned
over
his
table
,
boxing
his
papers
about
in
a
most
indecorous
manner
,
very
sad
to
behold
in

about
a
dozen

gasps
,
his
breast
lifting
the
bible
up
when
he
drawed
in
his
breath
,
and
letting
it
down
again
when
he
breathed
it
out—and
after
that
he
laid
still

he

warmer
.
|

of
how
she
who
lay
beside
him
had
locked
in
her
heart
for
so
many
years
that
image
of
her
lover's
eyes

told

|
his
love
,
of
the
dreams
and
the
hopes
which
had
troubled
him
four
years
before—and
he
felt
awkward
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

and
dreamed
.
|
|

how
much
life
exacts
for
the
worthless
or
very
commonplace
blessings
it
can
give
a
man
.

rubbing

nose

it
curious
that
it
was
necessary
to
use
his
eyes
to
discover
where
his
hands
were
.

|
|

|
|

|

managed
to
kneel
and
turn
and
crawl
for
home
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
traveled
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
,
near
catatonia
,
sometimes
on
his
feet
,
more
often
on
his

out
with

to
fish
,
shoveled
down
to
the
river
ice
,
chopped
through
it
with
a
maul
,

shivered
over

hook

into

on

|
down
the
stairs
noisily
.

into
the
pantry
hastily
and
put
on
his

.

supper
.
|
|
|
back
to
his
hotel
room
and
sat
for
a
long
while
on
the
sofa
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
,
then
he
had
dinner

a
long
nap

up
to
her
and
took
her
by
the
shoulders
to
say
something
affectionate
and
cheering
,

at
that
moment
he
saw
himself
in
the
looking-glass

the
traveler
,
pulled
out
the
small
leather
folder
once
more
,
leafed
through
it
,
finally
found
the
sheet
he
was
looking
for
,
and
showed
it
to
the
traveler
.

|
|
|
to
a
restaurant
and
drank
some
beer
,
then
set
off
to
walk
home
to
dyalizh
;
he
walked
all
the
way
singing
:
"'thy

me
so
languid

was
taken

in
with
a
sly
,
oily
look
in
his
eyes
,
smiling
mysteriously
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
which
were
cold
from
the
frost
.

up-town
with
the
man

was
telling
you
of
,
to
get
a
boat
and

if
they
could

another
gun

around

first
to

another

them
all

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
read
her
scribbled
dreams
,
but
they
seemed
to
be
senseless
poems
and
gave
him
no
clues
to
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

attentively
,
making
notes
,
and
from
time
to
time
raised
his
eyes
to
look
out
at
the
open
windows
or
at
the
fresh
,
still
dewy
flowers
in
the
vases
on
the
table
;
and
again
he
dropped
his
eyes
to
his
book
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
every
vein
in
his
body
was
quivering
and
fluttering
with
pleasure
.

wrote
a
great
deal
,
he
studied
italian
,
and
when
he
was
out
for
a
walk
,
thought
with
pleasure
that

soon
sit
down

again

with

rapidity

strapped
an
extra
battery
to
his

went
to
dig
out
the
truck
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
drove
it
slowly
back
up
the
slushy
road
in
the
moonlight
and
asked
if
she'd
like
to
go
to
town
the
next
morning

the

freezing
feet

from
his
mind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bought
food—a

frozen
pizzas
,
potatoes
,
eggs
,
carrots
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

nearly
wept
at
seeing
bananas
.

cried
he
was
so
glad
,
but
he
warn’t
surprised
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

watched
her
eat
,
the
spoon
sliding
out
of
her
mouth
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
while
she
slept
,
as
though
he
and
she
had
never
lived
together
as
man

took
the

,
rolling

up

told

was
awake

|
|

tried
to
soften
his
voice
.

|

keep
up
his
tone
of
cold
interrogation
,
but
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
humble
and
indifferent
.

to

the

the

the

his

canceled
his
trips

stewed
for
two
days

pacing

that

mary
jane
must
be
near
the
end
of
her
piece
for
she
was
playing
again
the
opening
melody
with
runs
of
scales
after
every
bar
and
while
he
waited
for
the
end
the
resentment
died
down
in
his
heart
.

at

water
from
the
mouth
made
a
noise
when
it
hit
the
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
worn
the
sort
of
nose
guard
bud
wore
when
it
was
cold
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
even
in
the
coldest
weather
these
streams
were
never
frozen
,
and
he
also
knew
their
danger
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

much
.
|
|
such
thoughts
caused
a
feeling
of
fright
in
him
and
he
was
afraid
of
such
feelings
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
number
of
anecdotes
,
charades
,
proverbs
,
and
was
fond
of
being
humorous
and
witty
,
and
he
always
wore
an
expression
from
which
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
were
joking
or
in
earnest
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
by
experience
that
when
his
nerves
were
out
of
hand
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
work
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
creek
was
frozen
to
the
bot-
tom
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bark
was
there
,
although
he
could
not
feel
it
with
his
fingers
.

principle
of
the
room
exactly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
must
not
fail
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
wondered
if
she
was
hypnotizing
him
,
but
it
didn't
matter
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
his
riot
of
emotions
of
an
hour
before
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
whether
the
toes
were
warm
or
whether
they
were
numb
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
could
feel
dune
grass
moving
against
his
shins
,
and
wind
coming
over
his
shoulders
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
on
his
neck
,
still
,
like
a
hot
paw
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
that
speaking
would
be
like
dashing
some
very
fragile
bond
to
pieces
,
like
kicking
a
dandelion
gone
to
seed
;
the
wispy
,
tenuous
sphere
of
its
body
would
scatter
in
the
wind
.

two
persons
talking
in

he
could
see
the
terra-cotta
and
salmon-pink
panels
of

skirt

the
shadow
made
appear
black
and
white
.

his
fingers
together
to
pull
them
out
of

,

he
was
able
to
gather
them
by
the
handful
.

up

carefully

have
flung
his
arms
about
her
hips
and
held
her
still
,
for
his
arms
were
trembling
with
desire
to
seize
her
and
only
the
stress
of
his
nails
against
the
palms
of
his
hands
held
the
wild
impulse
of
his
body
in
check

continued
scraping
his

vigorously
while
the
three
women

blinking
his

through

forest

|
then
took
from
his

pocket
a
little
paper

paused
for

moment
,
as
if
he

asking
the
traveler
for

more
detailed
reason

music

the
piece
she

no

he
doubted
whether
it
had
any

he

her
to

this
delicate
boy

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
question
her
again
,
for
he
felt
that
she
would
tell
him
of
herself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|
like
to
say
even
to
himself
that

he

that
it

her
pallor
,
her
new
expression

her
faint
smile
,
her
voice
,
and
soon
afterwards
he
disliked
her
clothes
,
too
,
the
low
chair
in
which
she
was
sitting

he
disliked
something
in

himself

acting
as

a

well-meaning

suffering
expression
which
was
intelligent
and
touching
:
she
seemed
to
him
altogether
graceful
,
feminine

and
simple

he

to
be
packed
night

night
,
of
how
one
night
an
italian
tenor
had
sung
five
encores
to
let
me
like
a
soldier
fall
,
introducing
a
high
c
every
time
,
and
of
how
the
gallery
boys
would
sometimes
in
their
enthusiasm
unyoke
the
horses
from
the
carriage
of
some
great
prima
donna

the

them
he
was
a
pirate—been
a
pirate
for
thirty
years
out
in
the
indian
ocean—and
his
crew
was
thinned
out
considerable
last
spring
in
a
fight
,
and
he
was
home
now
to
take
out
some
fresh
men
,
and
thanks
to
goodness
he’d
been
robbed
last
night
and
put
ashore
off
of
a
steamboat
without
a
cent
,
and
he
was
glad
of
it
;
it
was
the
blessedest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
him
,
because
he
was
a
changed
man
now
,
and
happy
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
;
and
,
poor
as
he
was
,
he
was
going
to
start
right
off
and
work
his
way
back
to
the
indian
ocean
,
and
put
in
the
rest
of
his
life
trying
to
turn
the
pirates
into
the
true
path
;
for
he
could
do
it
better
than
anybody
else
,
being
acquainted
with
all
pirate
crews
in
that
ocean
;
and
though
it
would
take
him
a
long
time
to
get
there
without
money
,
he
would
get
there
anyway
,
and
every
time
he
convinced
a
pirate
he
would
say
to
him
,
“don’t
you
thank
me
,
don’t
you
give
me
no
credit
;
it
all
belongs
to
them
dear
people
in
pokeville
camp-meeting
,
natural
brothers
and
benefactors
of
the
race
,
and
that
dear
preacher
there
,
the
truest
friend
a
pirate
ever
had
!

in
the
pitiful

looked
down

calm
a

at

softly

we

up

up

he

his

it

her
slender
,
delicate
neck
,
her
lovely
grey
eyes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
past—pure
,
chaste
,
laborious
;
he
remembered
what
he
had
learned
himself
and
what
he
had
taught
to
others
,
and
decided
that
there
was
no
exaggeration
in
the
monk's
words
.

already
felt
a
longing
to
go
to
restaurants
,
clubs
,
dinner-parties
,
anniversary
celebrations
,
and
he
felt
flattered
at
entertaining
distinguished
lawyers

artists

at
playing
cards
with
a
professor
at

had
a
plan
prepared
in
his
mind
:
he
would
go
up
to
nyuta
in
the
dark
,
would
take
her
by
the
hand
,
then
would
embrace
her
;
there
would
be
no
need
to
say
anything
,
as
both
of
them
would
understand
without
words
.

reached
s——
in
the
morning
,
and
took
the
best
room
at
the
hotel
,
in
which
the
floor
was
covered
with
grey
army
cloth
,
and
on
the
table
was
an
inkstand
,
grey
with
dust
and
adorned
with
a
figure
on
horseback
,
with
its
hat
in
its
hand

its
head
broken
off

considered
:
to-day
was
a
holiday
,
and
the
husband
would
probably
be
at
home
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
talked
,
thinking
all
the
while
that
he
was
going
to
see
her
,
and
no
living
soul
knew
of
it
,
and
probably
never
would
know
.

a

,
drank

smoked
expensive
cigars
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
always
seemed
to
women
different
from
what
he
was
,
and
they
loved
in
him
not
himself
,
but
the
man
created
by
their
imagination
,
whom
they
had
been
eagerly
seeking
all
their
lives
;
and
afterwards
,
when
they
noticed
their
mistake
,
they
loved
him
all
the
same
.

done
the
other
thing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
began
turning
over
the
music
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
on
the
sofa
and
clasped
his
hands
round
his
head
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
the
table
and
began
working
at
this
plan
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
calm
,
peaceful
,
indifferent
mood
was
coming

struck
one
chord
,
then
began
playing
,
and
sang
softly
,
"what

in

in
this
fashion
held
the

,

it
barked
and

.

near
the
monument
for
half
an
hour
,
then
paced
up
and
down
the
side
avenues
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
waiting
and
thinking
of
the
many
women
and
girls
buried
in
these
tombs
who
had
been
beautiful
and
fascinating
,
who
had
loved
,
at
night
burned
with
passion
,
yielding
themselves
to
caresses

|
in
the
snow
,
pulling
the
sticks
from
the
bushes
under
the
trees
and
feeding
them
directly
to
the
flame
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
,
into
which
he
cast
a
fleeting
glance
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
passed
the
governess
without
noticing
her
,
and
throwing
up
his
arms
,
exclaimed
:
"oh
,
how
horrible
it
is
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

really
did
something
for
vera
iosifovna
,
and
she
was
already
telling
all
her
visitors
that
he
was
a
wonderful
and
exceptional
doctor
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
up
to
go
into
the
house
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
and
in
exhaustion
walked
up
and
down
the
drawing-room
,
and
then
the
dining-room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
put
on
his
overcoat
,
and
went
into
the
"general
room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
began
walking
about
the
room
,
thinking
about
the
black
monk
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stretched
his
neck
out
about
a
minute
,
listening
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
from
the
table
,
picked
up
the
pieces
of
the
letter
and
threw
them
out
of
window
,
but
there
was
a
light
wind
blowing
from
the
sea
,
and
the
bits
of
paper
were
scattered
on
the
windowsill
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
between
ten
and
eleven
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
went
toward
the
dog
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
horsewhip
and
hit
him
across
the
face
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
hanging
around
the
widow’s
too
much
and
so
she
told
him
at
last
that
if
he
didn’t
quit
using
around
there
she
would
make
trouble
for
him
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|

going
away
so
much
,
too
,
and
locking
me
in
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
worked
up
,
and
got
to
running
on
so
about
his
troubles
,
he
forgot
all
about
what
he’d
been
a-going
to
do
.

an
immense
practice
in
the
town
,
no
time
to
breathe
,
and
already
has
an
estate
and
two
houses
in
the
town
,
and
he
is
looking
out
for
a
third
more
profitable
;
and
when
at
the
mutual
credit
bank
he
is
told
of
a
house
that
is
for
sale
,
he
goes
to
the
house
without
ceremony
,
and
,
marching
through
all
the
rooms
,
regardless
of
half-dressed
women
and
children
who
gaze
at
him
in
amazement
and
alarm
,
he
prods
at
the
doors
with
his
stick
,
and
says
:
"is
that

a

still
he
does
not
give
up
his
work
as
district
doctor
;
he
is
greedy

him

looks
sour

rumpled

dishevelled
;
there

his

anfissa

even
feels
very
wretched
when
he
recalls
the
scene
at
dinner
,
but
his
amour-propre
is
too
much
for
him
;
he
has
not
the

he

of

come
here

if

dozed
for

he

lie
awake

looked
at
his
father
any
more
,
nor
at
his
mother
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
done
nothing
to
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
spoke
;
he
moved
people
around
,
he
squeezed
in
late
ones
,
he
opened
up
passageways
,
and
done
it
with
nods
,
and
signs
with
his
hands
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
worked
from
morning
till
night
,
was
always
in
a
hurry
,
was
irritable
,
and
flew
into
rages
,
but
all
of
this
was
in
a
sort
of
spellbound
dream
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slowly
and
carefully
,
realizing
his
danger
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
carefully
,
even
collecting
an
armful
of
the
larger
branches
to
be
used
later
when
the
fire
gathered
strength
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
will
be
far
above
us
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
glanced
once
more
at
the
arm-chair
,
which
was
now
empty
,
felt
a
sudden
weakness
in
his
arms
and
legs
,
was
frightened
,
and
began
dressing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
really
standing
,
because
lack
of
feeling
in
his
feet
gave
him
no
relation
to
the
earth
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
crossed
by
the
footbridge
to
the
other
side
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
terrace
,
the
big
hall
and
the
drawing-room
,
and
there
stopped
to
take
breath
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
held
her
round
the
waist
with
both
arms
,
while
,
putting
her
hands
up
to
her
head
,
showing
the
dimples
in
her
elbows
,
she
set
her
hair
straight
under
the
kerchief
and
said
in
a
calm
voice
:
"you
must
be
tactful
,
polite
,
charming
,
and
you
can
only
become
that
under
feminine
influence
.

|

|
|
the
flame
of
the
matches
to
the
bark
that
would
not
light
readily
because
his
own
burning
hands
were
taking
most
of
the
flame
.
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
smoothed
his
hair
,
smiled
,
and
walked
three
times
to
and
fro
across
the
arbour
,
then
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
smiled
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
jumped
up
,
went
out
of
the
arbour
,
and
,
without
looking
round
,
walked
into
the
recesses
of
the
garden
furthest
from
the
house
.
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

yelling
,
and
the
first
thing
the
light
showed
was
the
varmint
curled
up
and
ready
for
another
spring
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hurriedly
put
on
his
trousers
,
flung
his
coat
over
his
shoulders
,
and
went
to
the
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can
overhear
everything
.
|
|
|
say
he
never
seen
us
together
,
and
it
‘ll
be
the
truth
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hide
it
in
his
bed
,
can’t
he
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hated
himself
,
hated
the
ticket
collectors
,
the
smoke
from
the
engine
,
the
cold
to
which
he
attributed
his
shivering
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
paced
up
and
down
the
"general
room
,"
and
went
into
avgustin
mihalitch's
room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
dined
away
from
home
and
returned
after
eight
o'clock
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
flattered
orlov
and
pekarsky
from
cowardice
,
because
he
thought
they
were
powerful
;
he
flattered
polya
and
me
because
we
were
in
the
service
of
a
powerful
man
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

and
his
family
existed
on
credit
,
borrowing
wherever
they
could
at
every
opportunity
,
even
from
his
superiors
in
the
office
and
porters
in
people's
houses
.

|
played
a
little
on
the
piano
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
dressed
,
washed
,
and
used
his
combs
and
brushes
silently
and
deliberately
,
as
though
allowing
himself
time
to
think
over
his
position
and
to
reflect
,
and
even
from
his
back
one
could
see
he
was
troubled
and
dissatisfied
with
himself
.

jim
up
in

lear’s
outfit—it
was
a
long
curtain-calico
gown
,
and
a
white
horse-hair
wig
and
whiskers
;
and
then
he
took
his
theater
paint
and
painted
jim’s
face
and
hands
and
ears
and
neck
all
over
a
dead
,
dull
,
solid
blue
,
like

nine

smiled
,
but
more
from
politeness
than
pleasure
,
and
when
she
spoke
of
anything
seriously
,
he
agreed
ironically
:
"oh
,
yes
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

contentedly
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
those
pieces
of
bread
,
each
of
which
enclosed
a
generous
portion
of
cooked
meat
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
,
and
when
the
names
of
ladies
of
their
acquaintance
were
mentioned
,
he
held
up
his
little
finger—as
though
to
say
they
mustn't
give
away
other
people's
secrets
.

flushed
,
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
,
and
instead
of
irony
,
his
face
wore
a
look
of
stupid
,
schoolboyish
dismay
.
|
|
|

|
|

more
and
more
rarely
slept
at
home
,
and
still
more
rarely
dined
there
:
on
thursdays
he
was
the
one
to
suggest
some
expedition
to
his
friends
.

|
|
|

straightened
his
coat
and
went
downstairs
irresolutely
.

engaged

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slowly
and
with
obvious
reluctance
drank
the
tea
,
and
returning
the
glass
to
me
,
asked
timidly
:
"can
you
give
me

|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
deceived
me
and
left
me
to
take
my
chance
in
petersburg
,
and
you
have
deceived
me
and
abandoned
me
here
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
congratulated
me
on
the
satisfactory
settlement
of
the
question
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
advised
me
to
see
pekarsky
at
once
and
to
take
the
birth
certificate
with
me
,
if
i
had
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
climbed
the
high
earth-bank
where
a
little-traveled
trail
led
east
through
the
pine
for-
est
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
the
ladder
,
holding
the
paper
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
,
looked
into
the
hole
and
then
at
the
condemned
man
,
observed
with
satisfaction
that
he
had
pulled
out
his
clothes
,
then
went
to
the
bucket
of
water
to
wash
his
hands
,
recognized
too
late
that
it
was
disgustingly
dirty
,
and
was
upset
that
now
he
couldn’t
wash
his
hands
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
excused
the
act
to
himself
by
looking
at
his
watch
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
plunged
among
the
big
pine
trees
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
expected
the
ice
formed
by
the
tobacco
juice
,
having
been
out
twice
before
when
it
was
very
cold
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
decided
he
would
eat
his
lunch
when
he
arrived
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that
the
flowing
stream
of
water
came
from
the
right
side
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
noticed
the
changes
in
the
creek
,
the
curves
and
the
bends
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
curved
away
from
the
place
where
he
had
been
walking
and
retraced
his
steps
several
feet
along
the
trail
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stepped
carefully
and
tested
the
ice
at
each
step
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
into
africa
.
|
|
|
|
removed
the
mitten
from
his
right
hand
and
helped
the
dog
tear
out
the
pieces
of
ice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
unbuttoned
his
jacket
and
shirt
and
pulled
forth
his
lunch
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
struck
the
fingers
repeatedly
and
returned
them
to
the
mitten
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
moved
them
inside
the
moccasins
and
decided
that
they
were
numb
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stamped
forcefully
until
the
feeling
returned
to
his
feet
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
threw
several
large
branches
on
top
of
the
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
now
received
the
full
force
of
the
cold
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
started
to
untie
his
moccasins
.
|
|
|
|
|
and
run
round
and
round
the
cabin
,
hollering
“take
him
off
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
should
not
have
built
the
fire
under
the
pine
tree
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
have
built
it
in
an
open
space
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
devoted
his
whole
soul
to
picking
up
the
matches
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
followed
the
movement
of
his
fingers
with
his
eyes
,
using
his
sense
of
sight
instead
of
that
of
touch
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
succeeded
in
getting
one
,
which
he
dropped
on
his
jacket
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
picked
up
the
match
in
his
teeth
and
drew
it
across
his
leg
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
beat
his
hands
,
but
failed
to
pro-
duce
any
feeling
in
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
caught
the
whole
pack
of
matches
between
his
hands
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
con-
tinued
to
endure
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
treated
the
flame
carefully
.
|
|
|
|
|
spoke
to
the
dog
,
calling
it
to
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
realized
that
he
could
not
kill
the
dog
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
no
longer
a
mere
problem
of
freezing
his
fingers
and
toes
,
or
of
losing
his
hands
and
feet
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
freed
it
and
it
dashed
wildly
away
,
still
barking
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pushed
this
thought
to
the
back
of
his
mind
and
refused
to
consider
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
seemed
to
be
flying
along
above
the
surface
and
to
have
no

it
was
only

he
took
a
good
gap

such
talk
in
his
life
before

trust
me
;
he
wanted
to
make
sure
of
having
me
out
of
the
way
the
whole
three
days
.

hadn’t
on
anything
but
a
shirt
,
and
he
was
very
frowzy-headed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
carried
a
mahogany
cane
with
a
silver
head
to

love
water-moccasins

go
around
hunting
for
them
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ain’t
ever
told
me
you
was
here
;
told
me
to
come
,
and
he’d
show
me
a
lot
of
water-moccasins
.

about
him

he’s

lined
out
two
lines
,
everybody
sung
it
,
and
it
was
kind
of
grand
to
hear
it
,
there
was
so
many
of
them
and
they
done
it
in
such
a
rousing
way
;
then
he
lined
out
two
more
for
them
to
sing—and
so
on

set
up
a
little
piece
of
poetry
,
which
he
made
,
himself
,
out
of
his
own
head—three
verses—kind
of
sweet
and
saddish—the
name
of
it
was
,
“yes
,
crush
,
cold
world
,
this
breaking
heart”—and
he
left
that
all
set
up
and
ready
to
print
in
the
paper
,
and
didn’t
charge
nothing
for
it

away
with

his

throwed
his
hat
down
in
the
mud

rode
over
it
,
and
pretty
soon
away
he
went
a-raging
down

stood
up
there
,
a-sailing
around
as
easy
and
comfortable
as
if
he
warn’t
ever
drunk
in
his
life—and
then
he
begun
to
pull
off

them

so
thick
they
kind

clogged
up

most
desperately
wanted
to
see
harvey—and
william
,
too
,
for
that
matter—because
he
was
one
of

kind
that
can’t
bear
to
make
a
will

left
a
letter
behind
for
harvey

said
he’d
told
in
it
where
his
money
was
hid
,
and
how
he
wanted
the
rest
of
the
property
divided
up
so
george’s
g’yirls
would
be
all
right—for
george
didn’t

it

it
was
mighty
still
in
there
,

everybody
bending
a

forwards

gazing
at
him

scolded
us
for
everything
,

we
couldn’t
seem
to
do
nothing
right
;
he
found
fault
with
every
little
thing
.

above
the
wing
the
sky
had
deepened
to
a
blue
so
pure
he
knew
it

bring
tears
to
his

him
a

read

.
|
|
|

he
could
hear
his
wife's
feet
pad
quietly
over
the
floorboards
.
|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|

them
the
stars
were
knife
points

hard

white

her
shoulder
a
star
separated
itself
from

melted
through
the
sky

|
now
it
was
dark
.
|
|
a
problem
of
life
and
death
with
the
cir-
cumstances
against
him
.

aren't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
after
this
candid
avowal
on
the
part
of
nikolay
sergeitch
,
she
could
not
remain
another
minute
,
and
could
not
understand
how
she
could
have
gone
on
living
in
the
house
before
.

sitting
in
the
arbour
,
thinking
of
his
examination
next
day
,
and
of
his
maman
,
at
whom
they
laughed
,
he
felt
an
intense
desire
to
see
nyuta
(that
was
what
the
shumihins
called
anna
fyodorovna)
,
to
hear
her
laughter
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress

he
must
build
the
fire
again
,
and
this
second
time
he
must
not
fail
.

valuing
his
morning
services
as
i
did
,
and
resolved
not
to
lose
them
;
yet
,
at
the
same
time
made
uncomfortable
by
his
inflamed
ways
after
twelve
o’clock
;
and
being
a
man
of
peace
,
unwilling
by
my
admonitions
to
call
forth
unseemly
retorts
from
him
;
i
took
upon
me
,
one
saturday
noon
(he
was
always
worse
on
saturdays)
,
to
hint
to
him
,
very
kindly
,
that
perhaps
now
that
he
was
growing
old
,
it
might
be
well
to
abridge
his
labors
;
in
short
,
he
need
not
come
to
my
chambers
after
twelve
o’clock
,
but
,
dinner
over
,
had
best
go
home
to
his
lodgings
and
rest
himself
till
tea-time
.

standing
up

for
forgiveness

the
man
grabbed
his
master
by
the
legs

shook
him

think
again
about
his
speech
and
about
the
quotation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
hall-door
was
closed
the
voice
and
the
piano
could
be
heard
more
clearly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
had
fallen
to
him
so
easily
,
he
wondered
why
he
had
been
so
diffident
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
!
|
forget
all
the
laws
of
optics
,
which
the
legend
does
not
recognise
,
and
listen
to
the
rest
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
have
become
more
sensible
and
stolid
,
but
i
am
just
like
every
one
else
:
i
am—mediocrity
;
i
am
weary
of
life
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
of
something
else
.
|
|
|
|
|
say
it
ain’t
a-goin’
to
be
more’n
two
hours
befo’
this
wrack
breaks
up
and
washes
off
down
the
river
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
want
to
ast
you
:
what’s
de
use
er
dat
half
a
bill
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ask
you—if
you
got
any
reasonableness
in
you
at
all—what
kind
of
a
show
would
that
give
him
to
be
a
hero
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
feeling
pretty
comfortable
all
down
one
side
,
and
pretty
uncomfortable
all
up
the
other
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
felt
neither
frightened
nor
ashamed
;
he
breathed
freely
and
easily
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
annoyed
that
he
had
not
gone
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
have
to
build
a
fire
and
dry
his
moccasins
and
socks
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
very
careful
.
|
|
|
|
keeps
the
cash
box
for
machinery
under
his
own
control
,
and
if
i
ask
him
for
a
new
strap
,
he
demands
the
torn
one
as
a
piece
of
evidence
,
the
new
one
doesn’t
arrive
for
ten
days
,
and
it’s
an
inferior
brand
,
of
not
much
use
to
me
.

hidden

were
beginning

blow
a

at

way
that
the

winds
up

this
:

thing
for

do

to

your

do
you
say—hey
?
|
|
|
|
|
and
then
,
in
the
eagerness
of
dispatching
pressing
business
,
i
would
inadvertently
summon
bartleby
,
in
a
short
,
rapid
tone
,
to
put
his
finger
,
say
,
on
the
incipient
tie
of
a
bit
of
red
tape
with
which
i
was
about
compressing

all
every
one

the

descended
over
chicago

its
galaxy
of
electric
lights

the
vast
neighborhoods
coming
clearer
as
the
plane
glided
toward
the
airport—streetlights
,
headlights
,
stacks
of
buildings
,
ice
rinks
,
a
truck
turning
at
a
stoplight
,
scraps
of
snow
atop
a
warehouse
and
winking
antennae
on
faraway
hills
,
finally
the
long
converging

worse
for

beyond

fifty-eight
years

felt
that
old
stirring
,
that
quickening
in
his
soul
,
and
would
rise
in
the
wide
pink
dawns

grab
his

drift

some

a

it

i

having

his

part
:
a

in

she
swallowed

slid
cleanly
out

she
didn't
seem
afraid

worried
about
where

,
about
the

that

thursday

complained
to
his
friends
of
the
intolerable
life
he
led
;
he
smoked
a
great
deal
,
and
said
with
irritation
:
"it

it's

fellow
said
he
‘lowed
to
tell
it
to
his
old
woman—she
would
think
it
was
pretty
good
;
but
he
said
that
warn’t
nothing
to
some
things
he
had
said
in
his
time
.

thing
to
see
,
looking
away
over
the
water
,
was
a
kind
of
dull
line—that
was
the
woods
on
t’other
side
;
you
couldn’t
make
nothing
else
out
;
then
a
pale
place
in
the
sky
;
then
more
paleness
spreading
around
;
then
the
river
softened
up
away
off
,
and
warn’t
black
any
more
,
but
gray
;
you
could
see
little
dark
spots
drifting
along
ever
so
far
away—trading
scows
,
and
such
things
;
and
long
black
streaks—rafts
;
sometimes
you
could
hear
a
sweep
screaking
;
or
jumbled
up
voices
,
it
was
so
still
,
and
sounds
come
so
far
;
and
by
and
by
you
could
see
a
streak
on
the
water
which
you
know
by
the
look
of
the
streak
that
there’s
a
snag
there
in
a
swift
current
which
breaks
on
it
and
makes
that
streak
look
that
way
;
and
you
see
the
mist
curl
up
off
of
the
water
,
and
the
east
reddens
up
,
and
the
river
,
and
you
make
out
a
log-cabin
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
,
away
on
the
bank
on
t’other
side
of
the
river
,
being
a
woodyard
,
likely
,
and
piled
by
them
cheats
so
you
can
throw
a
dog
through
it
anywheres
;
then
the
nice
breeze
springs
up
,
and
comes
fanning
you
from
over
there
,
so
cool
and
fresh
and
sweet
to
smell
on
account
of
the
woods
and
the
flowers
;
but
sometimes
not
that
way
,
because
they’ve
left
dead
fish
laying
around
,
gars
and
such
,
and
they
do
get
pretty
rank
;
and
next
you’ve
got
the
full
day
,
and
everything
smiling
in
the
sun
,
and
the
song-birds
just
going
it
!

night
in
her
garden
mysterious
sounds
,
so
strange
and
lovely
that
she
was
obliged
to
recognise
them
as
a
holy
harmony
which
is
unintelligible
to
us
mortals
,
and
so
flies
back
to
heaven
.

voice
,
made
plaintive
by
distance
and
by
the
singer's
hoarseness
,
faintly
illuminated
the
cadence
of
the
air
with
words
expressing
grief
:
o
,
the
rain
falls
on
my
heavy
locks
and
the
dew
wets
my
skin
,
my
babe
lies
cold

were
still
burning
redly
in
the
murky
air
and
,
across
the
river
,
the
palace

courts
stood
out
menacingly
against

heavy
sky

went
bounding
along

the
thoughts
went
rioting
through

,
proud
,
joyful
,
tender
,
valorous
.

of

his
body
drew
back
from
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
alive
,
like
the
dog
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
left
the
surface
of
his
body
and
he
now
began
to
shake
from
the
cold
.

saluted

said
:
"a

you
,
sir
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
along
the
way
he
had
come
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
at
his
hands
to
locate
them
and
found
them
hanging
on
the
ends
of
his
arms
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
steadily
ahead
.
|
|
|
|
put
more
tobacco
in
his
mouth
and
started
a
new
growth
of
yellow
ice
on
his
face
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
been
very
serious
when
he
said
that
no
man
should
travel
alone
in
that
country
after
50
below
zero
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
shocked
.
|
|
|
sat
in
the
snow
for
a
moment
and
struggled
for
calmness
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ran
blindly
in
fear
such
as
he
had
never
known
in
his
life
.
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

to
decipher
the
inscription

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
came
a-pawing
along
in
the
dark
,
and
when
packard
got
to
my
stateroom
,
he
says
:
“here—come
in
here
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|

out
:
“snatch

away

fool—ain’t
you
got
any
sense
?

that
had
a-holt
of
me
was
very
good
to
me
,
and
kept
saying
he
had
a
boy
about
as
big
as
me
that
died
last
year
,
and
he
was
sorry
to
see
a
boy
in
such
a
dangerous
fix
;
and
when
they
was
all
took
by
surprise
by
finding
the
gold
,
and
made
a
rush
for
the
coffin
,
he
lets
go
of
me
and
whispers
,
‘heel
it
now
,
or
they’ll
hang
ye
,
sure
!

i
ran
downstairs

slipped
out

there
was

shivering
.

would

tears
gathered
more
thickly
in
his
eyes
and
in
the
partial
darkness
he
imagined
he
saw
the
form
of
a
young
man
standing
under

dripping
tree
.

stories
told
of
the
immorality
in
such
places
as
yalta
are
to
a
great
extent
untrue
;
he
despised
them
,
and
knew
that
such
stories
were
for
the
most
part
made
up
by
persons
who
would
themselves
have
been
glad
to
sin
if
they
had
been
able
;
but
when
the
lady
sat
down
at
the
next
table
three
paces
from
him
,
he
remembered
these
tales
of
easy
conquests
,
of
trips
to
the
mountains
,
and
the
tempting
thought
of
a
swift
,
fleeting
love
affair
,
a
romance
with
an
unknown
woman
,
whose
name
he
did
not
know
,
suddenly
took
possession
of
him
.

gloomy

,
stretched
for
almost
three-quarters

ended

steep

pines

the

shone
below

gleam

the

hadn’t

,

korolyov
thought
neither

nor

thought
of
the
time
,
perhaps
close
at
hand
,
when
life
would
be
as
bright
and
joyous
as
that
still
sunday
morning
;
and
he
thought
how
pleasant
it
was
on
such
a
morning
in

spring
to
drive
with
three

in

woke
up
more

,
and
sung
louder

louder
;

towards
the
end
some
begun

one
thing

followed
again
at

with

off

took
comfort
in
the
fire

lying
at

close

away

held
his

from

.

opened
his

with

fierce
effort
.

|
|

|
|
|

result
was
a
long
piece
of
yellow
ice
hang-
ing
from
his
lips
.

action
took
no
more
than
a
quarter

in

the

touched
his

nature

for

thirty
years
has
brought
me
into
more
than
ordinary
contact
with
what
would
seem
an
interesting
and
somewhat
singular
set
of
men
,
of
whom
as

nothing

i

,
now
extinct

ambition
was
evinced
by
a
certain
impatience
of
the
duties
of
a
mere
copyist
,
an
unwarrantable
usurpation
of
strictly
professional
affairs
,
such
as
the
original
drawing
up
of
legal
documents
.

indigestion
seemed
betokened
in
an
occasional
nervous
testiness
and
grinning
irritability
,
causing
the
teeth
to
audibly
grind
together
over
mistakes
committed
in
copying
;
unnecessary
maledictions
,
hissed
,
rather
than
spoken
,
in
the
heat
of
business
;
and
especially
by
a
continual
discontent
with
the
height
of
the
table
where
he
worked
.

truth
was
,
i
suppose
,
that
a
man
with
so
small
an
income
,
could
not
afford
to
sport
such
a
lustrous
face
and
a
lustrous
coat
at
one
and
the
same
time
.

passiveness
of
bartleby
sometimes
irritated
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
conclusion
of
this
whole
business
was
,
that
it
soon
became
a
fixed
fact
of
my
chambers
,
that
a
pale
young
scrivener
,
by
the
name
of
bartleby
,
had
a
desk
there
;
that
he
copied
for
me
at
the
usual
rate
of
four
cents
a
folio
(one
hundred
words)
;
but
he
was
permanently
exempt
from
examining
the
work
done
by
him
,
that
duty
being
transferred
to
turkey
and
nippers
,
one
of
compliment
doubtless
to
their
superior
acuteness
;
moreover
,
said
bartleby
was
never
on
any
account
to
be
dispatched
on
the
most
trivial
errand
of
any
sort
;
and
that
even
if
entreated
to
take
upon
him
such
a
matter
,
it
was
generally
understood
that
he
would
prefer
not
to—in
other
words
,
that
he
would
refuse
point-blank
.

point

had
led
him
to
adopt
a

not

i

have
decided
upon
myself
;

as

report
was
this
:
that

in

dead
letter

at

,
from
which
he
had
been
suddenly
removed

had
an
expression
of
such
dog-like
resignation
that
it
looked
as
if
one
could
set
him
free
to
roam
around
the
slopes
and
would
only
have
to
whistle
at
the
start
of
the
execution
for
him
to
return

the

,

since
he
could
not
put

he

upward
with

uncovered

watching
,

without
understanding
.
|
|

|
|

|
making
signs
to
the
soldier
,
although
,
given
the
tight
straps
on
him
,
this
was
difficult
for
him
to
do
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
extremely
happy
to
get
the
handkerchiefs
back
,
but
he
couldn’t
enjoy
them
very
long
,
for
the
soldier
snatched
them
from
him
with
a
quick
grab
,
which
he
had
not
anticipated
.

of

|
|

whispered
something
to
him
,
and
the
soldier
nodded
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
nothing
and
smiled
slightly
to
himself
.

already
had
a
few
small
wounds
on
his
back
,
thanks
to
his
own
impatience
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
then
tried
to
pull
the
handkerchiefs
out
from
the
soldier’s
belt
,
where
he
had
put
them
for
safe
keeping
,
but
the
soldier
was
too
wary
.

seemed
to
be
struck

traveler
had
little
interest
in
the
apparatus
and
walked
back
and
forth
behind
the
condemned
man
,
almost
visibly
indifferent
,
while
the
officer
took
care
of
the
final
preparations

been
staring
for

time

he

that
a

in
the
inscriber
was
supposed
to
squeak
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
go
over
to
him
and
drag
him
to
the
officer’s
head
by
force
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
not
surprised
at
that
,
for
the
officer
spoke
french
,
and
clearly
neither
the
soldier
nor
the
condemned
man
understood
the
language
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
extremely
embarrassed
.
|
|
|
|
wanted
to
raise
various
questions
,
but
after
looking
at
the
condemned
man
he
merely
asked
,
“does
he
know
his
sentence
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
push
him
back
,
for
what
he
was
doing
was
probably
punishable
.

|

in
to
stop
the
whole
thing
,
if
possible
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
at
the
harrow
with
a
wrinkled
frown
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
over
at
the
soldier
and
the
condemned
man
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
have
been
happy
to
say
something
appreciative
,
but
all
he
saw
was
a
labyrinthine
series
of
lines
,
criss-crossing
each
other
in
all
sort
of
ways
.
|

himself
had
letters
of
reference
from
high
officials
and
had
been
welcomed
here
with
great
courtesy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
over
to
the
officer
and
said
,
“you
don’t
yet
know
what
i’ll
do
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
also
made
an
effort
so
that
at
least
he
could
satisfy
the
officer
,
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
say
anything
more
,
but
it
was
clear
that
he
was
still
unable
to
read
anything
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
followed
this
work
from
below
without
looking
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bit
his
lip
and
said
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
by
contrast
,
was
very
upset
.

down
at

writhed

the

the
torn-off
piece

leaning
into

ended

had
just
shaken
some
rice
pudding
into
the
bowl
from

.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
kept
pushing
him
away
,
for
the
pudding
was
probably
meant
for
a
later
time
,
but
in
any
case
it
was
not
proper
for
the
soldier
to
reach
in
and
grab
some
food
with
his
dirty
hands

eat
it
in

of

have
been
ready

do
that

the

took
the

direct
punishment

up

officer
had
hardly
noticed
the
earlier
indifference
of
the
traveler
,
but
he
did
have
a
sense
now
of
how
the
latter’s
interest
was
being
aroused
for
the
first
time
.

recognized
that
he
was
in
danger
of
having
his
explanation
of
the

held
up
for
a
long
time
.
|

threatened
the

with
his
fist
,
as
if

was
surprised
by
the
disturbance
it
created
.
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

|
turned
the
machine
off
,
and
in
the
silence
which
then
ensued
the
condemned
man
was
laid
out
under
the
harrow
.

|
|
|
|

|
|

kept
looking
at
the
traveler
from
the
side
,
without
taking
his
eyes
off
him
,
as
if
he
was
trying
to
read
from
his
face
the
impression
he
was
getting
of
the
execution
,
which
he
had
now
explained
to
him
,
at

superficially
.

yanked
him
up
off
the
stump

wanted
to
turn
his
head
aside
toward
the
pit
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

collected
himself
.
|
|
|
|
went
up
to
the
traveler
,
who
,
feeling
some
premonition
,
took
a
step
backwards
.
|

he
was
looking
at

of

left
him
alone
for

while

fact
that
with
such
an
eminent
visitor”—the
traveler
tried
to
deflect
the
honour
with
both
hands
,
but
the
officer
insisted
on
the
expression—“that
with

an
eminent
visitor

didn’t
even
once

he

comes
cordwood
floating
down

pieces
of

a

together

you

is
to

deck

after

,

him
and
the

played
seven-up
a

,
five

satisfied

so
the
duke
got
out
his
book
and
read
the
parts
over
in
the
most
splendid
spread-eagle
way
,
prancing
around
and
acting
at
the
same
time
,
to
show
how
it
had
got
to
be
done
;
then
he
give
the
book
to

the

turned
out
by

by
looking
pretty
rusty
;
but
after
they’d
jumped
overboard
and
took
a
swim
it
chippered
them
up
a

sweetened
everybody
up

made
himself
ever
so

;
and
he
give
out
the
idea
that
his
congregation
over
in
england
would
be
in

about
him
,
so
he

he’d
been

how

he
made
him
sigh
,
and
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
,

after
a

suspicioned

just
went
a
goo-gooing
around
,
happy
and
satisfied
,
like
a
jug
that’s
googling
out
buttermilk
;
and
as
for
the
king
,
he
just
gazed
and
gazed
down
sorrowful
on
them
new-comers

it
give
him
the
stomach-ache

spun
down

the
same
attitude
and
seemed
unaware
of
the
talk
about
her
at
last
she
turned
towards
them
and
gabriel
saw
that
there
was
colour
on
her
cheeks

that
her
eyes
were
shining

him
now
;
she
had
reached
across
and
was
poking
about
.

|
|
drinking
iced
tea
,
and
he
could
taste
it
in
his
mouth
,
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
trace
of
mint
.

over
,
with
part
of
her
upper
deck
above
water
,
and
you
could
see
every
little
chimbly-guy
clean
and
clear
,
and
a
chair
by
the
big
bell
,
with
an
old
slouch
hat
hanging
on
the
back
of
it
,
when

standing
right
under
the
dusty
fanlight
and
the
flame
of
the
gas
lit
up
the
rich
bronze
of
her
hair
,
which

her
drying
at

so
lightly
and
so
erect
that
he
longed
to
run
after
her
noiselessly
,
catch
her
by
the

say
something
foolish

affectionate
into

ear

wearing
the

béret
,
and
always
with
the
same
white
dog
;
no
one
knew
who
she
was

called

seemed
tired
.

|
|
fast
asleep
.
|
|
|
not
sure
whether
her
husband
had
a
post
in
a
crown
department
or
under
the
provincial
council—and
was
amused
by

he
was
standing
,
frightened
by

confusion

not
venturing
to
sit
down
beside
her
.

|
|
|

|

in
her
room

in

corner

looking

she

been
put
in
the
corner
as
a
punishment
.

pale

she
looked
at
him
,
and
did
not
smile
,
and
he
had
hardly
come
in
when
she
fell
on
his
breast
.

crying
from
emotion
,
from
the
miserable
consciousness
that
their
life
was
so
hard
for
them
;
they
could
only
meet
in
secret
,
hiding
themselves
from
people
,
like

so
disgusted
with
fedosya
vassilyevna
,
who
was
so
obsessed
by
her
illnesses
and
her
supposed
aristocratic
rank
,
that
everything
in
the
world
seemed
to
have
become
coarse

unattractive
because
this

it

could

neither
young
nor
beautiful—volodya
knew
that
perfectly
well
;
but
for
some
reason
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
her
,
looking
at
her
while
she
shrugged
her
plump
shoulders
and
moved
her
flat
back
as
she
played
croquet
,
or
after
prolonged
laughter
and
running
up
and
down
stairs
,
sank
into
a
low
chair
,
and
,
half
closing
her
eyes
and
gasping
for
breath
,
pretended
that
she
was
stifling
and
could
not
breathe

loose
wrapper

she
had
gone
to
bathe
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tidying
her
hair
,
which
was
difficult
to
put
in
order
because
it
was
so
thick
and
long
,
and
looked
absent-mindedly
at
volodya
.

sleepy
,
and
at
the
same
time
she
wanted
to
talk
endlessly
,
to
laugh
and
to
cry
,
and
to
go
to
a
restaurant
to
lunch
that
she
might
feel
her
freedom

carried
away
by
what
she
was
saying
,
and
by
being
near
the
man
she
loved
,
and
probably
because
her
tears
had
cleared
and
refreshed
her
soul
,
there
was
a
note
of
wonderful
candour
and
sincerity
in
her
voice

with
lace

terribly
changed

thinking

she

nor
hear
me

weeping
bitterly
,
with
sobs
,
and
her
long
,
unbrushed
hair
fell
on
her
knees
.

still
under
the
influence
of
the
dancing
,
the
music
,
the
talk
,
the
lights
,
and
the
noise

she
asked
herself

thus
afflicted
her

,
trying
to
think
of
the
most
offensive
,
biting
,
and
venomous
word
she
could
hurl
at
her
husband
,
and
at
the
same
time
she
was
fully
aware

i

there
warn’t

on
what
they

her
greatest
picture
when
she
took
sick
,
and
every
day
and
every
night
it
was
her
prayer
to
be
allowed
to
live

she

it
done

mighty
red
in
the

lighted

it

pretty

awful

scared

the

most
sand

|
|
|
|
|

smiling
all
over
so
she
could
hardly
stand—and
says

at
last
!

stopped
four

five
steps
from

no

smiled

climbed
out

curtsied
in
her
glittering
dress
.

|
|
|
|
|
smiled
as
if
it
were
the
resurrection
itself
.

|
at
him
,
leaned
over
from
the
dais
in
the
red
glow

shook
her
head

go
away

it
was
a
mean
practice

wasn’t
clean
,

i
must
try

not
do
it
any
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wicked
to
say
what
i
said
;
said
she
wouldn’t
say
it
for
the
whole
world
;
she
was
going

live

all
a

would
have
to
do
there

go
around

sing

forever

ever

had
to
have
things
handy
to
throw
at
them
when

no

that
was

i
would
hive
the
next
one
.

she’d
have
her
frocks
and
a
lot
of
other
traps
took
out
of
her
room
if
they
was
in
uncle
harvey’s

the
beautiful
trip
to
england
was
most
about
spoiled
for
her
;
she
didn’t
know
how
she
was
ever
going
to
be
happy
there
,
knowing
the
mother
and
the
children
warn’t
ever
going
to
see
each
other
no
more—and
then
busted
out
bitterer
than
ever
,
and
flung
up
her
hands
,
and
says
:
“oh

dear
,
dear

to

only
a
small
vinyl
purse
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
scanned
his
books
over
the
fireplace—a
monograph
on
grouse
habits
,
a
series
of
journals
on
upland
game
birds
,
a
thick
tome
titled
simply
bear
.

|

|
|
wasn't
bad
on
snowshoes
,
a
little
clumsy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
heard
it
after
a
minute
,
tuning
her
ears
in
to
something
like
a
drowsy
sigh
,
a
long
exhalation
of
slumber
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
again
.
|
|
|
the
lungs
fill
and
then
empty
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
otherworldly
screams
of
wounded
coyotes
come
up
through
the
floorboards
,
his
grunts
and
curses
as
he
fought
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
blood
slug
through
veins
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
stood
back
,
her
mouth
open
,
eyes
wide
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
before
him
for
an
instant
,
looking
at
him
strangely
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
put
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
knelt
in
the
snow
beside
the
den
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
me
in
them
new
clothes
again
,
and
i
couldn’t
do
nothing
but
sweat
and
sweat
,
and
feel
all
cramped
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
removed
the
mitten
from
her
other
hand
with
her
teeth
and
reached
down
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
felt
the
soft
silver
tips
of
fur
brush
her
cheeks
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
foreign
and
keen
sensitivity
bubbling
in
her
blood
,
as
if
a
seed
planted
long
ago
were
just
now
sprouting
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hot
all
over
,
and
was
ashamed
at
the
thought
that
her
little
secret
was
known
to
the
lady
of
the
house
;
and
all
this
terror
,
shame
,
resentment
,
brought
on
an
attack
of
palpitation
of
the
heart
,
which
set
up
a
throbbing
in
her
temples
,
in
her
heart
,
and
deep
down
in
her
stomach
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
now
neither
alarm
nor
shame
,
but
she
felt
an
intense
longing
to
go
and
slap
the
cheeks
of
this
hard
,
arrogant
,
dull-witted
,
prosperous
woman
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
miserable
,
insulted
,
and
choking
with
hate
as
she
listened
to
her
husband's
heavy
footsteps
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
held
him
by
the
hips
and
they
glided
through
the
blue
dawn
,
skating
up
the
frozen
coils
and
shoals
,
beneath
the
leafless
alders
and
cottonwoods
,
only
the
bare
tips
of
creek
willows
showing
above
the
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
an
open
book
on
her
knees
and
was
pointing
out
something
in
it
to
constantine
who
,
dressed
in
a
man-o-war
suit
,
lay
at
her
feet
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fell
to
her
knees
beside
the
bird
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slipped
off
her
mitten
and
closed
the
heron's
beak
in
her
fist
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pulled
off
her
mittens
and
touched
everything
she
could
:
bats
,
salamanders
,
a
cardinal
chick
tumbled
from
its
nest
,
still
warm
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
me
in
and
shut
the
door
;
then
she
looked
in
the
testament
till
she
found
the
paper
,
and
as
soon
as
she
read
it
she
looked
glad
;
and
before
a
body
could
think
she
grabbed
me
and
give
me
a
squeeze
,
and
said
i
was
the
best
boy
in
the
world
,
and
not
to
tell
anybody
.

saw
burrowed
dreamers
nestled
under
roots
against
the
long
twilight
,
their
dreams
rippling
into
the
sky
like
auroras
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
moved
through
the
door
like
a
show
horse
,
demure
in
the
way
she
kept
her
eyes
down
,
but
assured
in
her
step
;
she
brought
each
tapered
heel
down
and
struck
it
against
the
granite
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
her
lips
,
and
answered
:
"often
,
i
feel
wretched
almost
every
night
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wore
no
jewelry
,
no
wedding
ring
,
only
a
plain
black
suit
,
double-breasted
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
found
her
nametag
on
the
table
and
pinned
it
to
her
lapel
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
over
at
him
finally
,
a
look
of
recognition
,
of
warmth
,
and
then
looked
away
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
him
from
under
her
brows
for
a
moment
quizzically
until
he
smiled
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
for
a
moment
,
then
turned
to
mrs
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
asked
in
surprise
:
"what
for
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
and
evidently
expected
him
to
ask
her
to
go
into
the
garden
,
but
he
remained
silent
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
me
indifferently
,
listlessly
,
and
closed
her
eyes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
helplessly
at
the
soup
and
at
the
little
pies
,
waiting
for
the
trembling
to
pass
off
,
and
suddenly
she
could
not
resist
looking
at
polya
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
first
of
all
at
that
suit
and
at
the
hat
in
my
hand
,
then
turned
an
impatient
,
searching
glance
upon
my
face
as
though
studying
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
me
all
over
with
her
little
shiny
eyes
,
and
says
:
“what
might
your
name
be
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
did
not
look
at
him
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
wear
a
low-cut
bodice
and
the
large
brooch
which
was
fixed
in
the
front
of
her
collar
bore
on
it
an
irish
device
and
motto
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
feel
in
the
least
hungry
and
she
had
already
overstayed
her
time
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pull
her
hand
away
,
and
laughed
when
i
held
her
by
the
waist
,"
he
thought
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
know
that
i
,
a
footman
,
was
unhappy
on
her
account
,
and
used
to
ask
myself
twenty
times
a
day
what
was
in
store
for
her
and
how
it
would
all
end
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
seem
to
notice
the
presence
of
polya
,
who
was
still
living
with
us
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hear
me
come
in
,
or
heard
,
perhaps
,
but
did
not
pay
attention
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wandered
through
the
forest
,
but
never
very
far
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
longed
for
the
stillness
of
winter
,
the
long
slumber
,
the
bare
sky
,
the
bone-on-bone
sound
of
bull
elk
knocking
their
antlers
against
trees
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
began
to
sleep
,
taking
long
afternoon
naps
,
three
hours
or
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
go
off
for
weekends
,
disappearing
in
the
truck
before
he
was
up
,
a
fearless
driver
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
saying
good-bye
,
and
he—he
had
no
reason
for
staying
now—got
up
,
saying
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
home
;
his
patients
were
waiting
for
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
breathing
quickly
and
walked
very
quickly
,
but
not
to
the
house
,
but
further
into
the
park
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
assuring
him
she
would
not
stay
long
,
only
another
ten
minutes
,
only
five
minutes
;
but
the
tax-collector
stuck
obstinately
to
his
point
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
taught
herself
to
sleep
despite
heat
,
despite
noise
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knelt
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
felt
the
souls
of
coyotes
as
they
came
through
the
boards
on
their
way
skyward
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
put
her
palm
on
the
leathered
skull
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
motioned
for
o'brien
to
sit
beside
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
by
roadkill—a
crumpled
porcupine
,
a
shattered
deer
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hardly
ate
,
sleeping
eighteen
,
twenty
hours
a
day
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
threaded
twine
through
her
belt
loops
to
keep
her
trousers
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
asked
him
to
drop
her
off
at
the
library
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ate
three
pieces
.
|
|
|
|
sat
on
the
porch
,
reading
,
reading
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
in
the
third
row
,
and
when
gurov
looked
at
her
his
heart
contracted
,
and
he
understood
clearly
that
for
him
there
was
in
the
whole
world
no
creature
so
near
,
so
precious
,
and
so
important
to
him
;
she
,
this
little
woman
,
in
no
way
remarkable
,
lost
in
a
provincial
crowd
,
with
a
vulgar
lorgnette
in
her
hand
,
filled
his
whole
life
now
,
was
his
sorrow
and
his
joy
,
the
one
happiness
that
he
now
desired
for
himself
,
and
to
the
sounds
of
the
inferior
orchestra
,
of
the
wretched
provincial
violins
,
he
thought
how
lovely
she
was
.

wanted
other

about

primers
on
magic-working
and
conjury
that
had
to
be
mail-ordered
from
new
hampshire

to
say
something
wounding
to
him
,
but
immediately
she
caught
herself
in
this
antagonistic
feeling
,
she
was
frightened
and
went
out
of
the
bedroom
.

down

splashed
to
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
called
back
and
called
back
,
and
each
time
he
drove
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
and
went
quickly
to
the
door
;
he
followed
her
,
and
both
walked
senselessly
along
passages
,
and
up
and
down
stairs
,
and
figures
in
legal
,
scholastic
,
and
civil
service
uniforms
,
all
wearing
badges
,
flitted
before
their
eyes
.

moved
a
little
apart
with
her
husband
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mad
then
,
but
i
didn’t
mean
no
harm
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
come
out
to
the
truck
with
fifty
,
a
hundred—once
four
hundred—dollars
folded
into
her
pocket
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
understand
.
|
|
turn
and
look
at
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
come
down
to
dinner
nor
to
tea
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
go
out
for
a
walk
,
come
back
in
her
light
grey
dress
,
her
light
straw
hat
,
gay
,
warmed
by
the
spring
sun
;
and
sitting
by
my
bed
,
bending
low
down
over
me
,
would
tell
me
something
about
venice
or
read
me
those
books—and
i
was
happy
.

pressed
her
palm
to
the
truck's
grille
,
where
the
husks
of
insects
smoked
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
walked
past
him
into
the
cabin
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
like
her
father
with
a
little
hurried
step
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
with
little
ripping
steps
;
as
she
walked
she
swayed
,
or
,
as
they
say
,
wriggled
her
shoulders
and
back
.

hit
him
,
once
,
hard
across
the
mouth
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lived
in
manhattan
,
had
traveled
the
world
,
had
written
two
books
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
with
her
married
daughter
in
glasgow
and
came
to
dublin
on
a
visit
once
a
year
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
written
poems
about
the
valley
,
written
them
to
the
animals
:
you
rampant
coyote
,
you
glorious
buck
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
traveled
to
sudan
to
touch
the
backbone
of
a
fossilized
stegosaur
,
and
wrote
of
her
frustration
when
she
divined
nothing
from
it
.
|

through
the
academy
and
gave
a
pupils'
concert
every
year
in
the
upper
room
of
the

rooms
.
|
|
|

|

told
that
freddy
had
come
and
that
he
was
nearly
all
right
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
preceded
him
into
the
pantry
to
help
him
off
with
his
overcoat
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tried
to
make
him
ridiculous
before
people
,
heckling
him
and
staring
at
him
with
her
rabbit's
eyes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
no
longer
any
grace
of
attitude
,
but
gabriel's
eyes
were
still
bright
with
happiness
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
taken
off
her
hat
and
cloak
and
was
standing
before
a
large
swinging
mirror
,
unhooking
her
waist
.

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
grown
thinner
,
paler
,
had
grown
handsomer
and
more
graceful
;
but
now
she
was
ekaterina
ivanovna
,
not
kitten
;
she
had
lost
the
freshness
and
look
of
childish
naïveté
.

only
just
come
back
from
bathing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
four
long
sweeps
at
each
end
,
so
we
judged
she
carried
as
many
as
thirty
men
,
likely
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
five
big
wigwams
aboard
,
wide
apart
,
and
an
open
camp
fire
in
the
middle
,
and
a
tall
flag-pole
at
each
end
.

grit
to
pray
for
judus
if
she
took
the
notion—there
warn’t
no
back-down
to
her
,
i
judge
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nodded
her
head
gravely
.
|
|
|
|
|
answered
placidly
that
she
had
had
a
beautiful
crossing
and
that
the
captain
had
been
most
attentive
to
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
spoke
also
of
the
beautiful
house
her
daughter
kept
in
glasgow
,
and
of
all
the
friends
they
had
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
seemed
to
him
so
frail
that
he
longed
to
defend
her
against
something
and
then
to
be
alone
with
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
leaned
for
a
moment
on
his
arm
in
getting
out
of
the
cab
and
while
standing
at
the
curbstone
,
bidding
the
others
good-
night
.

lightly
on
his
arm
,
as
lightly
as
when
she
had
danced
with
him
a
few
hours
before
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
mounted
the
stairs
behind
the
porter
,
her
head
bowed
in
the
ascent
,
her
frail
shoulders
curved
as
with
a
burden
,
her
skirt
girt
tightly
about
her
.

too
,
would
soon
be
a

the
shade
of

his
horse

her
mother
,
had
reared
her
and
brought
her
up
,
spared
nothing
,
and
devoted
her
whole
life
to
having
her
daughter
taught
french
,
dancing
,
music
:
had
engaged
a
dozen
teachers
for
her
;
had
consulted
the

kept

,
the
daughter
of
a

suspected
of
theft
;
she

been

like
a

read
a
great
deal
,
used
phonetic
spelling
,
called
her
husband
,
not
dmitri
,
but
dimitri
,
and
he
secretly
considered
her
unintelligent
,
narrow
,
inelegant
,
was
afraid
of
her
,
and
did
not
like
to
be

talked
a
great
deal
and
asked
disconnected
questions
,
forgetting
next
moment
what
she
had
asked
;
then
she
dropped
her
lorgnette
in
the
crush
.

fond
of
arguing
,
accompanying
every
phrase
,
however
insignificant
,
with
expressive
mimicry
and
gesticulation
.

|
|
|

|
charming
nonsense
and
laughed
at
herself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
complained
that
she
slept
badly
,
that
her
heart
throbbed
violently
;
asked
the
same
questions
,
troubled
now
by
jealousy
and
now
by
the
fear
that
he
did
not
respect
her
sufficiently
.
|

turned
away
from
him
,
and
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
adored
him
,
and
it
was
unthinkable
to
say
to
her
that
it
was
bound
to
have
an
end
some
day
;
besides
,
she
would
not
have
believed
it
!

interrupted
the
doctor
,
preventing
his
speaking
,
and
there
was
a
look
of
effort
on
her
face
,
as
though
she
supposed
that
,
as
the
woman
of
most
education
in
the
house
,
she
was
duty
bound
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
the

he
said

persuaded
that
,
like
a
young
couple
,
we
shall
very
soon
go
for
a
honeymoon—that
is
,
she
wants
to
be
with
me
all
the
time
in

charming—exquisite
,
but
for
some
reason
now
when
i
am
going
home
,
i
feel
uneasy
,
as
though
i
expected
to
meet
with
something
inconvenient
at
home
,
such
as
workmen
pulling
the
stove
to
pieces

blocking
up
the

my

am
fond

her
,
poor
thing
!

|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

not
a
thief
and
has
not
got
such
a
repulsive
appearance
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
nice
child
!
|
|
|
|

frightened
me
last
night
;
i
can't
get
over
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
drank
madeira
,
ate
rapidly
,
and
talked
,
looking
at
him
through
her
pince-nez
:
"our
workpeople
are
very
contented
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
even
searched
mihailo
,
the
porter
,
herself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
could
not
imagine
a
greater
insult
.
|
|
|
|
|
laugh
or
sing
;
at
dinner
she
ate
nothing
;
did
not
sleep
for
nights
together
,
expecting
something
awful
,
and
was
so
worn
out
that
on
one
occasion
she
lay
in
a
dead
faint
from
dinner-time
till
evening
.

behaved
tactlessly
,
i
admit
it
as
a
gentleman
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
obstinately
banged
on
the
same
notes
,
and
it
sounded
as
if
she
would
not
leave
off
until
she
had
hammered
the
keys
into
the
piano
.
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|
|
|
|

|
took
his
arm
.
|
|
|
the
note
and
held
it
for
a
couple
of
minutes
before
her
eyes
,
and
during
that
time
her
face
wore
the
same
haughty
,
contemptuous
,
proud
,
and
harsh
expression
as
the
day
before
at
the
beginning
of
our
explanation
;
tears
came
into
her
eyes—not
timid
,
bitter
tears
,
but
proud
,
angry
tears
.

something
the

even

loves
the
work

went
on
for
a
long
time
complaining
of
her
father
and
her
hard
,
insufferable
life
in
that
house
,
entreating
kovrin
to
put
himself
in
her
place
;
then
she
began
,
little
by
little
,
smiling
,

her
husband

long
suspected
her
,
but
had
avoided
explanations
;
they
had
frequent
quarrels
,
and
usually
at
the
most
heated
moment
he
would
suddenly
subside
into
silence
and
depart
to
his
study
for
fear
that
in
his
exasperation
he
might
give
utterance
to
his
suspicions
or
she
might
herself
begin
to
speak
openly

all
about

declared
that
everything

delightful
,

swore
that
she
would
love
orlov
for
ever

these
vows
,
and
the
naïve
,
almost
childish
confidence
that
she

was
deeply
loved

forever

she

all
the

of
moving
into
another

of
driving
about
with
her

;
she
wants

she

meddle

as

,

confused

to
wring
from
him
a
counterfeit
smile
or
kiss
,
was
ready
to
go
on

knees
to
him
,
to
fawn
on
him

me
as

flunkey

a
being

a
rustle
of
her
skirt
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
passed
her
hand
over
her
hair

closed
her
eyes
wearily
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
listened
with
great
attention
,
and
said
without
letting
me
finish
:
"everything
there

|
|

always
listened
to
me
with
great
attention
,

at
interesting
places
she
rubbed
her
hands
as
though
vexed
that
it

not

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

never
spoke
to
me
of
her
condition
,
and
when
i
hinted
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
see
a
doctor
,
she
flushed
crimson
and
said
not

,
because
all
the
symptoms
was
first-rate
,
and
he’d
been
sleeping
like
that
for
ever
so
long
,
and
looking
better
and
peacefuller
all
the
time
,
and
ten
to
one
he’d
wake
up
in
his
right
mind
.

even
universities
,
apparently
,
were
interested
in
what
she
could
do
.

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
when
i'm

startsev
tried
to
talk
to
liberal
citizens
,
saying
,
for
instance
,
that
humanity
,
thank
god
,
was
progressing
,
and
that
one
day
it
would
be
possible
to
dispense
with
passports
and
capital
punishment
,
the
liberal
citizen
would
look
at
him
askance
and
ask
him
mistrustfully
:
"then
any
one
could
murder
any
one
he
chose
in
the
open
street
?

her
heart
was
heaviest
,
she
could
not
resist
glancing
into
a
looking-glass
if
she
passed
one
and
straightening
her
hair
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
after
a
winter
like
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
healthiest
person
can't
help
being
uneasy
if
,
for
instance
,
a
robber
is
moving
about
under
his
window
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
significance
of
our
meeting
today
has
been
increased
by
his
presence
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
the
way
her
dress
hung
on
her
,
he
saw
something
extraordinarily
charming
,
touching
in
its
simplicity
and
naïve
grace
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
in
spite
of
this
naïveté
,
she
seemed
to
him
intelligent
and
developed
beyond
her
years
.

useless
rubbish
is
collected
in
the
courtyards
nowadays
and
used
for
some
purpose
,
even
broken
glass
is
considered
a
useful
commodity
,
but
something
so
precious
,
so
rare
,
as
the
love
of
a
refined
,
young
,
intelligent
,
and
good
woman
is
utterly
thrown
away
and
wasted
.
|

he
succeeded
,
he
would
be
likely
to
lose
some
toes
.

one
is
a
foreigner
and
only
on
our
island
for
a
couple
of
days
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
with
the
strong
effort
that
he
made
,
his
trembling
fingers
would
not
obey
and
the
sticks
were
hopelessly
scattered
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
then
he
was
outside
of
himself
,
standing
with
the
boys
and
looking
at
himself
in
the
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
,
for
the
most
part
,
i
regarded
bartleby
and
his
ways
.

|
|

|
|
|
|

|

|
your
visit
today
seems
to
me
typical
of
the
whole
situation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
outside
the
terminal
the
sky
was
thick
and
gray
and
hurried
by
wind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
the
wind
was
already
stripping
leaves
from
the
cottonwoods—too
soon
,
he
thought
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
the
hall
,
with
the
door
slammed
he
was
laughing
and
she
was
crying
,
and
they
both
stood
appalled
at
the
other's
reaction
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
snow
was
coming
.
|
|
falling
in
big
wet
flakes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
blew
down
his
collar
and
drifted
around
his
boots
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
were
in
the
car
for
forty-five
minutes
,
passing
first
the
tall
,
lighted
architecture
of
downtown
,
then
naked
suburban
oaks
,
heaps
of
ploughed
snow
,
gas
stations
,
power
towers
,
and
telephone
wires
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fussy
,
that
was
all
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
standing
on
the
crowded
platform
and
he
was
placing
a
ticket
inside
the
warm
palm
of
her
glove
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
expecting
her
husband
to
come
,
but
a
letter
came
from
him
,
saying
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
eyes
,
and
he
entreated
his
wife
to
come
home
as
quickly
as
possible
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
driving
the
whole
day
.
|
|
|
|
|
silent
.
|
|
talking
of
something
,
but
,
seeing
kovrin
,
ceased
at
once
,
and
he
concluded
from
their
faces
that
their
talk
had
been
about
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
both
exhausted
by
the
journey
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
amused
that
the
obstinate
man
who
despised
all
the
common
place
details
of
love
had
been
caught
in
feminine
snares
in
such
a
simple
and
ordinary
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
coated
with
ice
.
|
|
|
|
presumably
dock
workers
,
strong
men
with
short
,
shiny
,
black
beards
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
poor
,
oppressed
people
.
|
|
|
|
|
awfully
young
,
wendy
and
peter
,
for
death
thoughts
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
rhubarb
pie
in
a
hotel
restaurant
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gone
in
under
the
door
,
chewing
and
digging
the
frozen
earth
under
the
foundation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
only
flour
and
a
few
crackers
in
the
cupboards
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
officers'
backs
,
but
had
already
decided
that
there
was
not
one
handsome
or
interesting
man
among
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

been
married
five
years
.
|
|
|
|
|
hardly
gone
when
aunt
julia
wandered
slowly
into
the
room
,
looking
behind
her
at
something
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
go
visiting
together
and
,
as
he
had
not
answered
her
,
miss
ivors
said
warmly
:
"of
course
,
you've
no
answer
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
opened
it
,
but
did
not
know
how
to
shut
it
,
though
they
had
scratched
the
lock
all
over
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
tea
with
cakes
.
|
|
|
|
come
across
the
mountain
from
the
indian
creek
country
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
from
the
quarry
and
stood
around
the
stile
a
while
,
and
then
went
on
around
the
garden
fence
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
big
brass
dog-irons
that
could
hold
up
a
saw-log
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pictures
hung
on
the
walls—mainly
washingtons
and
lafayettes
,
and
battles
,
and
highland
marys
,
and
one
called
“signing
the
declaration
.

white
domestic
awnings
in
front
,
and
the
country
people
hitched
their
horses
to
the
awning-posts
.

them
frauds
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ate
.
|
|
went
creaking
over
wind-scalloped
snow
in
the
nearly
unbearable
cold
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
off
to
the
air
closet
,
where
a
wind
sucked
them
like
brown
leaves
up
the
flue
to
their
slumber
rooms
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knelt
.
|
|
listened
,
face-to-face
,
their
ears
over
woodpecker
holes
in
the
trunk
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sat
for
dinner
at
a
narrow
and
very
long
table
,
fifteen
or
so
high-backed
chairs
down
each
side
and
one
at
each
end
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wanted
to
see
grizzlies
,
track
a
wolverine
,
shoot
sandhill
cranes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

the
heads
of
seven-by-seven
royal
bulls
for
their
dens
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
heated
water
for
baths
and
dressed
in
clothes
they
hadn't
worn
in
six
months
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stopped
at
the
bitterroot
for
hamburgers
and
rhubarb
pie
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
came
across
a
bull
elk
frozen
to
death
in
a
draw
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
never
spoke
.
|
|
|
would
not
wish
for
worlds
that
any
of
mary
jane's
pupils
should
see
him
under
the
influence
;
and
when
he
was
like
that
it
was
sometimes
very
hard
to
manage
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
think
that
he
was
airing
his
superior
education
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
come
handy
by
and
by
,
i
judged
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
both
kissed
gabriel
frankly
.
|
|
|
|
got
powerful
mellow
,
but
i
noticed
the
king
didn’t
get
mellow
enough
to
forget
to
remember
to
not
deny
about
hiding
the
money-bag
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
followed
him
in
silence
,
their
feet
falling
in
soft
thuds
on
the
thickly
carpeted
stairs
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
halted
,
too
,
on
the
steps
below
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
walked
and
talked
of
the
strange
light
on
the
sea
:
the
water
was
of
a
soft
warm
lilac
hue
,
and
there
was
a
golden
streak
from
the
moon
upon
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
talked
of
how
sultry
it
was
after
a
hot
day
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
low
and
earnest
.
|
|
|
|
|
found
a
cab
and
drove
to
oreanda
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nothing
here
.
|
|
|
|
saw
a
steamer
come
from
theodosia
,
with
its
lights
out
in
the
glow
of
dawn
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
caught
glimpses
of
ladies
,
of
fur
coats
hanging
on
pegs
;
the
draughts
blew
on
them
,
bringing
a
smell
of
stale
tobacco
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
forgave
each
other
for
what
they
were
ashamed
of
in
their
past
,
they
forgave
everything
in
the
present
,
and
felt
that
this
love
of
theirs
had
changed
them
both
.

|
|

drove
in
at
the
factory
gates
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
off
.
|
|
|
have
lectures
with
a
magic
lantern
,
a
splendid
tea-room
,
and
everything
they
want
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ruined
everything
;
they
have
spoilt
everything
;
they
have
done
everything
filthy
,
horrible
,
and
abominable
.

|
|
|
|
are
very
much
attached
to
us
,
and
when
they
heard
that
lizanka
was
worse
they
had
a
service
sung
for
her
.

|
|

to
the

a

him

to

the

pressing

,

the
whole

following

got
a

and
shoved
the
bag
through
a
rip
in
the
straw
tick
that
was
under
the
feather-bed
,
and
crammed
it
in
a
foot
or
two
amongst
the
straw
and
said
it
was
all
right
now
,
because
a
nigger
only
makes
up
the
feather-bed
,
and
don’t
turn
over
the
straw
tick
only
about
twice
a
year
,

it
warn’t

of
getting
stole

me

all
the

living
on
a
little
farm
down
at
the
bottom
of
arkansaw
,

my
sister
mary
ann
run
off

never
was

bill
went
to

them
and
he
warn’t
heard
of
no
more
,
and
tom
and
mort
died
,
and
then
there
warn’t
nobody
but
just
me
and
pap
left
,
and
he
was
just
trimmed
down
to
nothing
,
on
account
of
his
troubles
;
so
when
he
died
i
took
what
there
was
left
,
because
the
farm
didn’t
belong
to
us
,
and
started
up
the
river
,
deck
passage
,
and
fell
overboard
;

that

how
i

there
a-thinking

scratching

the

bust
into

judged
it
was
him
,
anyway
;
said
this
drownded
man
was
just
his
size
,
and
was
ragged
,
and
had
uncommon
long
hair
,
which
was
all
like
pap
;
but
they
couldn’t
make
nothing
out
of
the

,

it

it

a

him

the
grangerfords
stayed
on

horses

capered
around
the

fidgety

they

taking
off

putting

scratching

something

that
they
can

on
;
and
it
takes
them
weeks

weeks

months

months

the

good
a
start
;
they
got
to
the
woodpile
that
was
in

up

sherburn’s

a-whooping
and
raging
like
injuns
,
and
everything
had
to
clear
the
way
or
get
run
over
and
tromped
to
mush
,

it

awful

the

hit
no
project
that
suited
exactly
;
so
at
last
the
duke
said
he
reckoned
he’d
lay
off
and
work
his
brains
an
hour
or
two
and
see
if
he
couldn’t
put
up
something
on
the
arkansaw
village
;
and
the
king
he
allowed
he
would
drop
over
to
t’other
village
without
any
plan
,
but
just
trust
in
providence
to
lead
him
the
profitable

him

he
never

they
took
him
to
the

cabin
,

put
his
own
clothes
on
him
,
and
chained
him
again
,

not

and
said
he
warn’t
to
have
nothing
but
bread
and
water
to
eat
after
this
till
his
owner
come
,
or
he
was
sold
at
auction
because
he
didn’t
come
in
a
certain
length
of
time
,
and
filled
up
our
hole
,
and

a
couple
of
farmers
with
guns
must
stand
watch
around
about
the
cabin
every
night
,
and
a
bulldog
tied
to
the
door
in
the
daytime
;
and
about
this
time
they
was
through
with
the
job
and
was
tapering
off
with
a
kind
of
generl
good-bye
cussing
,
and
then
the
old
doctor
comes
and
takes
a
look
,
and
says
:
“don’t

she
parked
in
the
driveway
of

elaborate
modern
mansion

with
square
balconies
suspended
over
two
garages

huge
triangular
windows

again

herself
this

good-humouredly

added
quickly
:

took

asked
.
|
,
after
a
pause
.
|
|
|
|
and
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
again
.
|
|
|
|

|
clutching
the
hand
he
stretched
out
to
the
monk

yawning

the
footman
in
a
weary
,
injured
voice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
wonder
,
glancing
at
his
radiant
,
ecstatic
face
and
eyes
full
of
tears

|
|

softly

joyfully

ashamed

her
mistrust

.
|
|
suddenly
,
turning
round
.

|
|
|
|
|
stayed
.
|
like
that
for
whole
minutes
,
the
hunter
standing
over
her
,
feeling
the
cold
come
up
his
legs
,
afraid
to
touch
her
as
she
knelt
before
the
bird

turned
to
him
.
|
|
|
her
hands
palms
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
as
if
to
appeal
to
the
good
sense
of
the
others
against
a
refractory
child
while
aunt
julia
gazed
in
front
of
her
,
a
vague
smile
of
reminiscence
playing
on
her
face
.

away
from
the
mirror
slowly
and
walked
along
the
shaft
of
light
towards
him
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
regained
her
health
,
took
on
energy
,
no
longer
lay
under
furs
dreaming
all
day
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stood
,
trembling
.
|
|
|
|
was
in
butte
or
missoula
when
he
discovered
her
money
in
a
boot
:
six
thousand
dollars
and
change
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
overwhelmed
,
and
huddling
and
shrinking
together
,
seemed
ten
years
older
all
at
once
,
while
he
thought
her
beautiful
and
expressed
his
rapture
aloud
:
"how
lovely
she
is
!

|
|
|
|

|
tired
out
and
excited
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
came
back
out
on
the
porch
.
|
|
|
|
|
.
|
|
into
the
room
.
|
|
|
|
to
him
and
put
her
body
against
him
and
cried
steadily
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cried
.
|
in
horror
,
pushing
him
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
knocking
at
his
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
breathing
hard
.
|
|
|
|
|
moved
into
the
circle
and
unfastened
the
lids
of
the
caskets
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
broke
out
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
glanced
at
her
husband
,
whose
admiring
and
happy
eyes
had
been
wandering
from
her
dress
to
her
face
and
hair
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
loose
from
him
and
ran
to
the
bed
and
,
throwing
her
arms
across
the
bed-rail
,
hid
her
face
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
.
|
,
not
looking
at
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
breathing
hard
,
still
pale
and
overwhelmed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
giving
startsev
her
hand
,
and
he
could
see
that
her
heart
was
beating
with
excitement
;
and
looking
at
him
intently
and
curiously
,
she
went
on
:
"how
much
stouter
you
are
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
floods
of
scalding
tears
streamed
from
her
big
eyes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
looked
into
my
face
sarcastically
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
forcing
herself
to
say
something
serious
and
edifying
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
blushing
crimson
.
|
|
|
|
in
terror
.
|
|
an
undertone
,
going
to
the
door
and
peeping
out
into
the
passage
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
french
,
dropping
down
before
orlov
,
and
laying
her
head
on
his
knees
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cajolingly
,
evidently
wishing
to
flatter
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
softly
.
|
|
through
her
tears
.
|
|
|
|
at
last
,
in
the
dark
room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
worked
herself
into
a
passion
and
would
have
continued
in
defence
of
her
sister
for
it
was
a
sore
subject
with
her
but
mary
jane
,
seeing
that
all
the
dancers
had
come
back
,
intervened
pacifically
:
"now
,
aunt
kate
,
you're
giving
scandal
to
mr

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
on
to
the
window
and
stood
there
,
looking
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
softly
,
coming
up
to
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sarcastically
.
|
|
|
by
coach
and
he
went
with
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
did
not
answer
nor
yield
wholly
to
his
arm
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
once
.
|
|
|
|
shed
tears
,
but
was
so
sad
that
she
seemed
ill
,
and
her
face
was
quivering
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
raised
her
head
from
her
arms
and
dried
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
hand
like
a
child
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
away
from
him
along
the
shaft
of
light
towards
the
window
in
silence
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
him
with
dread
,
with
entreaty
,
with
love
;
she
looked
at
him
intently
,
to
keep
his
features
more
distinctly
in
her
memory
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
greedily
into
his
face
,
to
stamp
his
dear
features
on
her
memory
,
then
she
put
her
arms
gracefully
round
his
neck
and
laid
her
head
on
his
breast
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
beyond
him
,
at
the
nursery
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
paused
for
a
moment
and
sighed
.
|
|
|
to
get
her
voice
under
control
,
and
then
went
on
:
"then
the
night
before
i
left
,
i
was
in
my
grandmother's
house
in
nuns'
island
,
packing
up
,
and
i
heard
gravel
thrown
up
against
the
window
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stopped
,
choking
with
sobs
,
and
,
overcome
by
emotion
,
flung
herself
face
downward
on
the
bed
,
sobbing
in
the
quilt
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
as
though
she
wanted
to
say
something
,
then
awkwardly
thrust
a
note
into
his
hand
,
ran
home
and
sat
down
to
the
piano
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
made
no
answer
.
|
|
|
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
her
son
,
and
said
in
french
,
turning
to
nyuta
:
"he's
rather
like
lermontov

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hid
her
face
on
his
breast
and
pressed
close
to
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
glanced
at
him
and
turned
pale
,
then
glanced
again
with
horror
,
unable
to
believe
her
eyes
,
and
tightly
gripped
the
fan
and
the
lorgnette
in
her
hands
,
evidently
struggling
with
herself
not
to
faint
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pressed
his
hand
and
began
rapidly
going
downstairs
,
looking
round
at
him
,
and
from
her
eyes
he
could
see
that
she
really
was
unhappy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
her
hands
on
her
temples
,
and
went
on
impulsively
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
could
not
speak
;
she
was
crying
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
listened
and
looked
into
his
face
;
her
eyes
were
sorrowful
and
intelligent
,
and
it
was
evident
she
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
smiled
again
,
raised
her
eyes
to
the
doctor
,
and
looked
at
him
so
sorrowfully
,
so
intelligently
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
trusted
him
,
and
that
she
wanted
to
speak
frankly
to
him
,
and
that
she
thought
the
same
as
he
did
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
brought
her
fork
down
on
the
plate
with
a
clatter
,
and
her
eyes
flashed
angrily
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
explained
.
|
|
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
as
though
perplexed
and
not
knowing
what
he
wanted
of
her
,
but
she
got
up
and
went
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fascinated
him
by
her
freshness
,
the
naïve
expression
of
her
eyes
and
cheeks
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
up
and
continued
standing
,
"but
,
forgive
me
,
i
cannot
be
your
wife
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wrote
to
him
.
|
|
|
|
took
his
arm
.
|
|
|
a
bottle
of
something
out
of
the
cupboard
,
went
to
the
window
,
read
the
label
,
and
went
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ten
gold
coins
out
of
her
pocket
and
said
:
"look
,
my
good
sir
;
i
have
won
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
talked
a
long
while
and
with
great
feeling
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sobbed
,
trembling
all
over
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
began
dressing
,
too
.
|
|
|
|
crying
again
,
while
i
walked
to
the
piano
and
sat
down
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
.
|
|
sang
,
as
prima-donnas
sing
at
the
opera
when
they
hear
something
awful
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tore
the
letter
open
impatiently
,
and
holding
it
in
both
hands
,
so
that
i
saw
her
sparkling
diamond
rings
,
she
began
reading
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
genuinely
believed
that
i
was
hardly
a
human
being
,
but
something
infinitely
below
her
,
that
,
like
the
roman
matrons
who
were
not
ashamed
to
bathe
before
their
slaves
,
she
sometimes
went
about
in
my
presence
in
nothing
but
her
chemise
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gave
me
no
reply
,
but
simply
made
a
contemptuous
grimace
,
and
,
looking
that
time
at
her
cold
eyes
and
over-fed
expression
,
i
realised
that
for
her
complete
and
finished
personality
no
god
,
no
conscience
,
no
laws
existed
,
and
that
if
i
had
had
to
set
fire
to
the
house
,
to
murder
or
to
rob
,
i
could
not
have
hired
a
better
accomplice
.

soon
left
off
crying
.
|
|
|
|
|
would
say
with
zest
.
|
|
|
|
ask
as
she
passes
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
already
divined
by
instinct
that
zinaida
fyodorovna
would
not
be
with
us
much
longer
,
and
,
not
to
let
the
chance
slip
,
carried
off
everything
she
set
her
eyes
on—smelling-bottles

tortoise-shell

handkerchiefs

repeated
in
a
shrill
voice
breaking
with
indignation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
.
|
|
quickly
got
on
to
her
feet
,
and
looked
at
me
without
understanding
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
understood
and
believed
me—i
saw
that
from
her
sudden
pallor
,
and
from
the
way
she
laid
her
arms
upon
her
bosom
in
terror
and
entreaty
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
walked
away
from
the
piano
and
said
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
:
"there's
no
need
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lifted
up
her
head
,
and
looking
at
me
with
tear-stained
eyes
through
her
hair
,
wet
with
her
tears
,
and
pushing
it
back
as
it
prevented
her
seeing
me
,
she
asked
:
"they
laughed
at
me
?

|
still
had
her
doubts
.
|
|
|
|
|
flushed
.
|
crimson
,
and
to
hinder
my
speaking
,
said
quickly
:
"you
love
life
,
and
i
hate
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
poured
herself
out
some
tea
,
but
did
not
touch
it
,
went
into
the
bedroom
,
and
lay
down
.

the

asked

with
an
air
of
concern

perhaps
false

them
in

glanced
back
at
him
over
her

and
said
with
great
bitterness
:
"the

peal
of

followed

from

glowing

on

"when

coldly

rudely
,
never
looked

with
irony

while

up

after
they
had
played
three
rubbers

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gave
her
a
snowsuit
,
strapped
her
boots
into
a

of
leather
snowshoes

took
her
to
hear

standing
still

breath

pause

playfully
,
looking

at

arm

onto

shift
across

to

all

drove
them
home

coldly

hastily
in

with
a
sigh

his
eyebrows

looking
at

curiosity

laughing

as
they
went
from

into
the
room
next
to
the
study

|
|
|
|
|
|

softly
,
going
up
to
his
table

this
in
jest
,
but
after
he
had
said
it
,
tears
glistened
in

eyes

in

.

lobbed
the
money
into
the
yard
.
|

|
stood
on
the
mat
,
scraping
the
snow
from
his
goloshes
,
while
lily
led
his
wife
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
out
:

put
on

rapidly
towards
the
door

|
|
|
|
waited
outside
the
drawing-room
door
until
the
waltz
should
finish
,
listening
to
the
skirts
that
swept
against
it
and
to
the
shuffling
of
feet
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
set
to
his
supper
and
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
with
which
the
table
covered
lily's
removal
of
the
plates
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

made
a
circle
in
the
air
with
his
arm
and
paused
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
muttered
.
|
|
thought
when
he
woke
and
looked
at
the
dark
windows
:
it
was
already
evening
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
and
went
back
to
the
music-books
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looking
at
the
crimson
windows
.

of

who
was
so
pleased
with
yegor
semyonitch's
articles
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
after
she
had
gone
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sat
on
the
bed
,
which
was
covered
by
a
cheap
grey
blanket
,
such
as
one
sees
in
hospitals
,
and
he
taunted
himself
in
his
vexation
:
"so
much
for
the
lady
with
the
dog

down
with
a
sigh
and
tenderly
stroked
her
hand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
explained
that
,
too
.
|
|
|
|
|
mentioned
his
name
and
pressed
her
hand
,
a
large
,
cold
,
ugly
hand
;
she
sat
up
,
and
,
evidently
accustomed
to
doctors
,
let
herself
be
sounded
,
without
showing
the
least
concern
that
her
shoulders
and
chest
were
uncovered

deliberately
as
he
put
on
his
gloves
,
while
madame
lyalikov
stood
without
moving
,
and
looked
at
him
with
her
tearful
eyes
.

to
tell
her
that
he
had
a
great
deal
of
work
in
moscow
,
that
his
family
were
expecting
him
home
;
it
was
disagreeable
to
him
to
spend
the
evening
and
the
whole
night
in
a
strange
house
quite
needlessly
;
but
he
looked
at
her
face
,
heaved
a
sigh
,
and
began
taking
off
his
gloves
without
a
word
.

straightened
her
hair

that
had
fallen
over
her
forehead

|
|
|

|
|

glanced
at

went
to
his

went
to
bed

study
,
and
a
minute
later
returned
with
the
letter
.

back

dinner

|
|
|
on
breathlessly
.
|
|
|
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
as
though
he
had
said
something
very
amusing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
into
the
study
,
and
gruzin
slouched
in
,
too
,
dragging
his
rug
after
him
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

came
in
and
stood
still
near
the
door
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
added
,
addressing
pava
in
the
hall
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
read
this
letter
,
thought
a
moment
,
and
said
to
pava
:
"tell
them
,
my
good

that

|
|
grumbles
angrily
,
wrapping
his
dressing-gown
about
him
and
spitting
loudly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mutters
;
"i

|
|
|

asks

|
|
laughed
and
took
her
arm
.
|
|
|
|
|
joyfully
,
and
pressing
his
forehead
on
pekarsky's
back
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
kissed
both
her
hands
ardently
,
and
went
on
:
"i
have
just
passed
through
an
exalted
,
wonderful
,
unearthly
moment

|
|

|
|
|
|

,
and
stroking
them
tenderly
,
said
that

two

pressed
his
head
tightly
in
his
hands

said
miserably
:
"why
,
why
have
you
cured
me
?

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
felt
intense
irritation
,
and
to
avoid
saying
too
much
,
he
got
up
quickly
and
went
into
the
house
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fell
on
the
floor
,
and
propping
himself
on
his
arms
,
called
again
:
"tanya

called
to

great
garden
with
the
gorgeous
flowers
sprinkled
with
dew
,
called
to
the
park
,
the
pines
with
their
shaggy
roots
,
the
rye-field
,

marvellous
learning
,
his
youth
,

peter's
voice
outside
,
against
the
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wondered
in
agony
,
clasping
his
hands
and
looking
up
to
the
sky
in
horror
.

|
|
|

did
not

sat
in

hugging
his

thinking
.

laid
his
strong
,
pungent
cigar
in

conspicuous
place

put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knew
perfectly
well
that
what
his
mother
said
was
true
;
in
what
she
was
saying
about
general
shumihin
and
about
baroness
kolb
there
was
not
a
word
of
lying
,
but
nevertheless
he
felt
that
she
was
lying

little

weedy-looking
children

smelt
of
the
nursery

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
left
his
goloshes
in
the
hall
,
and
,
without
taking
off
his
long
,
heavy
fur
coat

went
into

decorously

was
silent

drank
some
more

it
through

it
a

under

surprise

got
up
,
walked
about
,
biting
his
nails

patted
her

paused

tried
to
feel
into
himself
to
see
what

really
there

him

caught

went

orlov
received

in
the
evening
she
was
writing
letter

letter

sent
me
out
first
to
pekarsky
,
then
to
gruzin
,
then
to
kukushkin
,

finally
anywhere
i

if

i
,
too
,
lay
down
.

|
|
to
find
out
from
the
hall
porter
whether
the
sledge
was
at

remember
one
evening
she
went
in
like
that
,
irresolutely
and
inappropriately
,
and
sank
on
the
rug
at
orlov's
feet
,
and
from
her
soft
,
timid
movements
one
could
see
that
she
did
not
understand
his
mood

was
afraid

was
about
to

,

suddenly
broke
into
a
violent
cough
,
and
clutched
at
the
side
of
the
door
to
save
myself
from
falling
.

next
morning
i
gave

the
receipt

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
heard
hysterical
weeping
mingled
with
laughter
.

|
|
|
|
|
an
alarmed
voice
in
the
drawing-room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
brought
him
a
glass
of
tea
and
a
decanter
of
brandy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

thought
indignantly
,
though
it
was
evident
that
she
was
bored
by
his
company
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cried
,
catching
up
kukushkin

impetuously
,
holding
out
my
hands
to
her
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
in
horror
,
wringing
my
hands
and
going
up
to
her
quickly
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
breathless
,
"your
excellency

|
impatiently
.

|
,
shrugging
my
shoulders
.
|
|
|
|
|
genuinely
.

did
not
like
this
beginning

i
did
not
care
to
alter
it

write
another

looked
out
of
window
to
the
sea
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
.
|
|
|
|
mentioned
my
name
,
and
,
speaking
very
rapidly
that
she
might
not
interrupt
me
or
go
away
,
explained
to
her
who
i
was
and
why
i
was
living
there

the
basket

the
peasant
woman

got
into
the
cab

told
the
man
to
drive
slowly
to
the
nevsky
prospect

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
,
took
a
turn
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
,

went
out
into
the
corridor

|
|

told
her
again
who
i
was
,
and
why
i
was
living
at
orlov's
,
and
i
told
her
at
greater
length

in
more
detail
than
the
day
before

long
stories

my
really
astounding
adventures

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
repeated
,
and
for
the
first
time
during
our
acquaintance
i
kissed
her
hand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wondered
,
recalling
her
face
and
her
agonised
look
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
ask
,
following
her
into
the
room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
imagined
her
with
a
sick
and
morbid
face
,
in
her
condition
,
tightly
laced
,
standing
near
the
gaming-table
in
a
crowd
of
cocottes
,
of
old
women
in
their
dotage
who
swarm
round
the
gold
like
flies
round
the
honey

felt
that

was
on

point
of
tears
,
and
ceased
speaking
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
shrugged
my
shoulders
.
|
|
|
|
wanted
to
go
on
to
speak
of
mercy
,
of
forgiveness
,
but
there
was
an
insincere
note
in
my
voice
,
and
i
was
embarrassed

spoke
her
name
softly

read
this
letter

and
sonya
sat
on
the
table
and
gazed
at
me
attentively
without
blinking

she
knew

being
decided

a
tall
wizen-faced
man
,
with
a
stiff
grizzled
moustache
and
swarthy
skin
,
who
was
passing
out
with
his
partner
,
said
:

|
look
of
perplexity
appeared
on
gabriel's
face
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fat
brown
goose
lay
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
at
the
other
end
,
on
a
bed
of
creased
paper
strewn
with
sprigs
of
parsley
,
lay
a
great
ham
,
stripped
of
its
outer
skin
and
peppered
over
with
crust
crumbs
,
a
neat
paper
frill
round
its
shin
and
beside
this
was
a
round
of
spiced
beef
.

chorus
of
voices
invited
him
to
begin
his
own
supper
and
lily
came
forward
with
three
potatoes
which
she
had
reserved
for
him
.

hearty
murmur
of
assent
ran
round
the
table
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
flew
across
gabriel's
mind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
minute
later
zinaida
fyodorovna
had
forgotten
the
trick
played
by
the
spirits
,
and
was
telling
with
a
laugh
how
the
week
before
she
had
ordered
some
notepaper
and
had
forgotten
to
give
her
new
address
,
and
the
shop
had
sent
the
paper
to
her
old
home
at
her
husband's
,
who
had
to
pay
twelve
roubles
for
it
.

week
after
this
conversation
orlov
announced
that
he
was
again
ordered
to
attend
the
senator
,
and
the
same
evening
he
went
off
with
his
portmanteaus

moment
later
they
heard
the
screams
.

"julia

summarily

starting
to
wonder
.
|
|
|
|
|
his
wizened
face
broke
into
a
broader
smile
,
and
the
three
young
ladies
laughed
in
musical
echo
to
his
pleasantry
,
swaying
their
bodies
to
and
fro
,
with
nervous
jerks
of
their
shoulders

little
jump

paused
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen

watched
the
stove
busy
humming
to
itself
,
making
supper
for
four

for

"neither

said
mr

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
on
the
landing
outside
the
drawing-room
gabriel
found
his
wife
and
mary
jane
trying
to
persuade
miss
ivors
to
stay
for
supper
.

|
|
|

above
them
two
schoolboys
were
smoking
and
looking
down
,
but
that
was
nothing
to
gurov
;
he
drew
anna
sergeyevna
to
him
,
and
began
kissing
her
face
,
her
cheeks
,
and
her
hands
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
sheet
which
she
gave
there
was
written
in
orlov's
hand
:
"i
am

but
miss
ivors
broke
away
from
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
man
could
not
hear
with
the
noise
of
the
furnace
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
three
days
passed
,
a
week
passed
;
he
still
did
not
go
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
suddenly
he
listened
,
and
,
with
a
terrible
face
,
ran
off
and
quickly
disappeared
behind
the
trees
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
then
waves
began
running
across
the
rye
,
and
a
light
evening
breeze
softly
touched
his
uncovered
head
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
this
point
the
real
yegor
semyonitch
,
suddenly
coming
to
himself
,
would
make
a
terrible
face
,
would
clutch
his
head
and
cry
:
"the
devils
!

|

|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

|
|

once
,
as
though
afraid
,
he
would
get
up
and
walk
from
the
piano
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
had
to
go
to
the
house
,
come
what
might
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
her
thoughts
immediately
took
another
turn
,
and
she
began
talking
of
another
flat
,
of
wallpapers
,
horses
,
a
trip
to
switzerland
and
italy
.
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
as
usual
he
got
up
suddenly
and
tossed
his
head
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
was
so
weak
that
she
could
not
carry
these
bijoux
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wendy
was
back
.
|
|

"here

nobody
answered
this
question
and
mary
jane
led
the
table
back
to
the
legitimate
opera

"five
days

there
was
a
brief
silence

|
|
|
water-melon
on
the
table
.
|
|
|
|
|
terrible
screaming
from
the
nursery

resounded
from

abruptly

sharply

from
the
past
he
preserved
memories
of
careless
,
good-natured
women
,
who
loved
cheerfully
and
were
grateful
to
him
for
the
happiness
he
gave
them
,
however
brief
it
might
be
;
and
of
women
like
his
wife
who
loved
without
any
genuine
feeling
,
with
superfluous
phrases
,
affectedly
,
hysterically
,
with
an
expression
that
suggested
that
it
was
not
love
nor
passion
,
but
something
more
significant
;
and
of
two
or
three
others
,
very
beautiful
,
cold
women
,
on
whose
faces
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
rapacious
expression—an
obstinate
desire
to
snatch
from
life
more
than
it
could
give
,
and
these
were
capricious
,
unreflecting
,
domineering
,
unintelligent
women
not
in
their
first
youth
,
and
when
gurov
grew
cold
to
them
their
beauty
excited
his
hatred
,
and
the
lace
on
their
linen
seemed
to
him
like
scales

|
|
|
|
|
|
into
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
seat
under
the
old
maple
,
just
as
they
had
done
four
years
before

downstairs

down
the
hall

all
looked
into
their
plates

mashenka
fancied
after

words

every
one

looking

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

began
talking
of
kukushkin's
indefatigable
energy
in
love
affairs
,
how
irresistible
he
was
to
women
,
and
what
a
danger
he
was
to
husbands
;
and
how
the
devil
would
roast
him
in
the
other
world
for
his
immorality
in
this
.

place
in

a
seat
under

old
spreading
maple

walked
down
the
hall
of
their
soundproofed
happylife
home
,
which
had
cost
them
thirty
thousand
dollars
installed
,
this
house

clothed

fed

iii
at
home
in
moscow
everything
was
in
its
winter
routine
;
the
stoves
were
heated
,
and
in
the
morning
it
was
still
dark
when
the
children
were
having
breakfast
and
getting
ready
for
school
,
and
the
nurse
would
light
the
lamp
for
a
short
time
.

the
following
evening
he
went
to
the
turkins'
to
make
an
offer
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
one
evening
,
coming
out
of
the
doctors'
club
with
an
official
with
whom
he
had
been
playing
cards
,
he
could
not
resist
saying
:
"if
only
you
knew
what
a
fascinating
woman
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
in
yalta
!

|

|

|
|
hour
passed
,
another
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
these
words
,
so
ordinary
,
for
some
reason
moved
gurov
to
indignation
,
and
struck
him
as
degrading
and
unclean
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that
morning
at
the
station
a
poster
in
large
letters
had
caught
his
eye
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
is
all
that
can
be
said
about
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
may
be
true
,
but
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
judge
of
orlov
by
what
he
read
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
"be
so
good"
had
a
peculiar
,
unfeminine
sound
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
at
that
instant
he
recalled
how
when
he
had
seen
anna
sergeyevna
off
at
the
station
he
had
thought
that
everything
was
over
and
they
would
never
meet
again
.

|
|

did
not
eat
a
morsel
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
twelve
o'clock
the
next
day
zinaida
fyodorovna
died
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
seemed
as
though
in
a
little
while
the
solution
would
be
found
,
and
then
a
new
and
splendid
life
would
begin
;
and
it
was
clear
to
both
of
them
that
they
had
still
a
long
,
long
road
before
them
,
and
that
the
most
complicated
and
difficult
part
of
it
was
only
just
beginning
.

|
|
|

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
four
minutes
to
strike
twelve
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
inwardly
he
thought
:
"it's
high
time
she
was
married
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
followed
all
sorts
of
details
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
near
all
the
buildings
,
and
then
behind
the
barracks
and
beyond
the
gates
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
on
,
all
in
the
same
style
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
thought
about
the
devil
,
in
whom
he
did
not
believe
,
and
he
looked
round
at
the
two
windows
where
the
fires
were
gleaming
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
what
he
meant
in
a
roundabout
way
:
"you
in
the
position
of
a
factory
owner
and
a
wealthy
heiress
are
dissatisfied
;
you
don't
believe
in
your
right
to
it
;
and
here
now
you
can't
sleep

|
|
|
|
waves
his
handkerchief
.
|
|
|
|
turned
back
.
|
|
|
marched
about
the
house
turning
off
the
voice
clocks
,
the
stoves
,
the

she
shuddered
.
|
|
got
up
from
the
table
,
scraping
her
chair
awkwardly
,
and
went
out
quickly
,
still
more
overcome
with
confusion
.

went
out

to
prevent
herself
from
crying
.

saying
something
more
,
madame
kushkin
rustled
her
long
skirts
and
went
out
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
for
some
reason
every
one
sighed
.
|

|
|
|
|
every
one
roared
with
laughter
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
when
,
at
tea
or
supper
,
startsev
observed
in
company
that
one
should
work
,
and
that
one
ought
not
to
live
without
working
,
every
one
took
this
as
a
reproach
,
and
began
to
get
angry
and
argue
aggressively
.

at
a
neighbouring
table
there
is
talk
of
the
turkins
,
he
asks
:
"what
turkins
are
you
speaking
of
?
|
|

as
he
does
so
he
breathes
heavily
and
wipes
the
sweat
from
his
brow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
for
the
rest
of
it
,
what
is
called
a
career
,
a
future
,
that
was
clear
;
volodya
would
go
into
the
army
or
the
telegraph
service
,
or
he
would
go
into
a
chemist's
shop
and
work
his
way
up
till
he
was
a
dispenser

older

plainer

she
walks
out
of

then
followed
an
inappropriate
,
affected
,
and
insincere
regret
that
peasants
who
stole
fruit
and
broke
the
branches
could
not
nowadays
be
flogged
.

unseemly
vulgarities
followed—by
way
of
showing
me
special
attention
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
heard
the
sounds
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
from
behind
the
door
came
a
faint
voice
,
weak
with
crying
but
still
determined
:
"leave
me
alone
,
if
you
please
.

now
volodya
felt
sorry
that
he
had
not
had
more
boldness
there
in
the
arbour
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
everything
was
in
that
style
,
and
everything
was
a
subject
for
laughter
.

had
walked
off
to
his
study
,
she
had
run
after
him
like
a
cat
after
a
mouse
,
and
,
preventing
him
from
shutting
the
door
,
she
had
cried
that
she
hated
him
with
her
whole
soul
.

not
able
to
think
of
anything
to

,
i
hit
him
two
or
three
times
on
the
face
with
the
roll
of
paper
.

i
went
off
to
my
room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
although
their
beds
tried
very
bard
,
the
two
adults
couldn't
be
rocked
to
sleep
for
another
hour
.

peter
strolled
off
to
the
nursery
.

|
|
the
three
of
them
went
babbling
off
while
he
let
himself
be
vacuumed
upstairs
through
the
air
flue
and
set
about
dressing
himself
.

|
|
|

|
some
one
was
coming
up
the
stairs
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
called
to
him
at
the
gates
in
an
abrupt
voice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
"wait
;
i'll
tell
you
directly
.
|

|
|
|
|
a
moment
,
you'll
see
,"
said
his
wife
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
then
they
spent
a
long
while
taking
counsel
together
,
talked
of
how
to
avoid
the
necessity
for
secrecy
,
for
deception
,
for
living
in
different
towns
and
not
seeing
each
other
for
long
at
a
time

sat
down
in
the
drawing-room

very
serious
faces

read
her
novel

there
was
half
a
minute
of
stillness
,
and
from
another
building
there
came
sounds
equally
abrupt
and
unpleasant
,
lower
bass
notes
:

,
with
the
same
rapid
step
and
preoccupied
face
,
he
made
the
round
of
the
whole
garden
,
and
showed
his
former
ward
all
his
greenhouses
and
hot-houses
,
his
covered-in
garden
,
and
two
apiaries
which
he
called

she
described
how
she
had
broken
with
her
husband
the
day
before

her
eyes
were
alternately
full
of
tears

of
laughter

down
on

chair
by
the

,
leaning
her
head
on

madame
lyalikov—a
stout
elderly
lady
wearing
a
black
silk
dress
with
fashionable
sleeves
,
but
,
judging
from
her
face
,
a
simple
uneducated
woman—looked
at
the
doctor
in
a
flutter
,
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
hold
out
her
hand
to
him

she

examined

and

his

wondered

both
wept
bitterly

"our

at

after

the

shown
to
his

been
made
up

he
did

suddenly
there
came
a
strange
noise
,
the
same
sound
korolyov
had
heard
before
supper
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
a
ring
at
the
bell

eleven
times

|
twelve
times

they
?

"go

mashenka
went
into
her
room
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
it
was
her
lot
to
experience
in
all
its
acuteness
the
feeling
that
is
so
familiar
to
persons
in
dependent
positions
,
who
eat
the
bread
of
the
rich
and
powerful
,

cannot
speak
their
minds

bitterly

remembered
that
under
the
sheets
in
her
basket
she
had
some
sweetmeats
,
which
,
following
the
habits
of
her
schooldays
,
she
had
put
in
her
pocket
at
dinner

her

made
no

shook
her

,
amazed

frightened
,
went
on
packing
;
she
snatched
her
things
,
crumpled
them
up

thrust
them
anyhow
into

the
basket

dropped

about

heaved
a

went
in
at
the
little
gate
,
and
before
anything
else
he
saw
the
white
crosses
and
monuments
on
both
sides
of
the
broad
avenue
,
and
the
black
shadows
of
them
and
the
poplars
;
and
for
a
long
way
round
it
was
all
white
and
black
,
and
the
slumbering
trees
bowed
their
branches
over
the
white
stones

evening
he
went
to
the
turkins'
.

|
|
thought
of
the
notes
he
used
to
take
out
of

pleasure

out

the

not

he

soaked
with

a

he
thought
of
his
uncontrollable
shyness
,
his
lack
of

,
his
freckles
,
his
narrow
eyes
,
and
put
himself
in

him

at

to

of

slowly
as

heard
the

through
the

faintly
falling
,
like
the
descent

upon
all

was
fading
out
into

grey
impalpable
world
:
the
solid
world
itself
,
which
these
dead
had
one

lived

and
tangled
and
greasy
,

hung
down
,

you

see

through

behind
vines
.

freeze
.

grew
blurred
and
misty
.
|

|
|
|
|
hands
began
trembling
,
his
neck
swelled
and
turned
purple
,
he
ordered
his
racing
droshky
and
drove
off
somewhere
.

were
trembling
,

he
had
a
feeling
in
his
chest

stomach
as

cold
waves
were
running
all
over
his
inside
.

was
long
and
thin
,
and
every
day
of
his
life
he
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
a
full
suit
from
head
to
foot
made
out
of
linen
so
white
it
hurt
your
eyes
to
look
at
it
;
and
on
sundays
he
wore
a
blue
tail-coat
with
brass
buttons
on
it
.

flowed
in

directions

lips
were
puckered
up
suavely
,
and
his
little
trimmed
moustaches
looked
as

been
fixed
on
with
glue
.

pressed
firmly
together
,
his

open

,

calm
and
convinced
.

was
a
flabby
nature
;
he
was
so
lazy
that
he
did
not
care
what
became
of
himself
,
and
drifted
along
heedless
where
or
why
he
was
going
.

pace
of
four
miles
an
hour
had
kept
his

pushing
the

to
all
parts
of

were
not

was
able
to
press
the

tightly
against

.
|

was
burning
.
|

made
him
push
it
too
far
and
he
scattered
the

fire
over

wide

.
|

arms
stretched
out
to
hold
the

of
running
until
he
arrived
at
the
camp
and
the
boys
pre-

sented
one
problem
:
he
lacked
the
endurance
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

that
he
had
been
acting
like
a
fool
.
|
|

mind
went
from
this
to
the
thought
of

countenance
became
intolerably
fervid
,
as
he
oratorically
assured
me—gesticulating
with
a
long
ruler
at
the
other
end
of
the
room—that
if
his
services
in
the
morning
were
useful
,
how
indispensible
,
then
,
in
the

?

his
freedom
from
all

,
his
incessant

(except
when
he
chose
to
throw
himself
into
a
standing
revery
behind
his

,
his
great
stillness

his
unalterableness

him

he
saw
strange

utterly

pretension

shallow
defiance

it

not
exactly
that

i
felt

i
almost
believed
,
that
when
i
had
cast
off
at
last
my
long
,
bony
,
bearded
frame
,
i
should
go
on
living
in
those
little
blue
eyes
,
that
silky
flaxen

those
dimpled

which
stroked
my

were

my

he

much
for
the
adventure

thought
korolyov
,
sitting
on
the
planks
,
and
little
by
little
he
was
possessed
by
a
feeling
that
this
unknown
and
mysterious
force
was
really
close
by
and
looking
at
him
.

|
the
search
had
been
thorough
,
most
thorough
.

started
walking
close
to
the
man’s
heels
and
followed
him
along

|
officer
appeared
to
him
all
the
more
admirable
in
his
tight
tunic
weighed
down
with
epaulettes
and
festooned
with
braid
,
ready
to
go
on
parade
,
as
he
explained
the
matter
so
eagerly
and
,
while
he
was
talking
,
adjusted
screws
here
and
there
with
a
screwdriver
.

went
over
to
him
and
said
,
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
traveler
,
“the

very
complicated

traveler
,
who
had
up
to
this
point
been
leaning
back
,
bent
forward
again
and
kept
up
his
questions
,
“but
does
he
nonetheless
have
some
general
idea
that
he’s
been
condemned
?

the

went
to
overhauling

said
these
arkansaw
lunkheads
couldn’t
come
up
to
shakespeare
;
what
they
wanted
was
low
comedy—and
maybe
something
ruther
worse
than
low
comedy
,
he
reckoned
.

it
was
kind
of
hard
to
have
to
lay
roped
all
day
,
and
he’d
cipher
out
some
way
to
get
around
it
.

king
went
all
through
the
crowd
with
his
hat
swabbing
his
eyes
,
and
blessing
the
people
and
praising
them
and
thanking
them
for
being
so
good
to
the
poor
pirates
away
off
there
;
and
every
little
while
the
prettiest
kind
of
girls
,
with
the
tears
running
down
their
cheeks
,
would
up
and
ask
him
would
he
let
them
kiss
him
for
to
remember
him
by
;
and
he
always
done
it
;
and
some
of
them
he
hugged
and
kissed
as
many
as
five
or
six
times—and
he
was
invited
to
stay
a
week
;
and
everybody
wanted
him
to
live
in
their
houses
,
and
said
they’d
think
it
was
an
honor
;
but
he
said
as
this
was
the
last
day
of
the
camp-meeting
he
couldn’t
do
no
good
,
and
besides
he
was
in
a
sweat
to
get
to
the
indian
ocean
right
off
and
go
to
work
on
the
pirates
.

about
pretty
much
everybody

very
next
morning
at
the
streak
of
dawn
we
got
another
letter
ready
,
and
was
wondering
what
we
better
do
with
it
,
because
we
heard
them
say
at
supper
they
was
going
to
have
a
nigger
on
watch
at
both
doors
all
night
.

you
won't
stay
,
then
?
|
|
|
|
|
weren’t
acquainted
with
monroe
?
|
|
|
|
|
had
it
in
your
pocket
all
the
time
;
and
like
as
not
you’ve
got
the
other
things
there
,
too
.

|
|
|

|
|
|

|
|

many
memories
!
|
|
|
that
he
was
seen
at
one
time
in
africa
,
at
another
in
spain
,
then
in
italy
,
then
in
the
far
north

turkey’s
paroxysms
only
coming
on
about
twelve
o’clock
,
i
never
had
to
do
with
their
eccentricities
at
one
time
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
revenge
.
|
|
|
cooled
them
down
a
little
,
because
the
people
that’s
always
the
most
anxious
for
to
hang
a
nigger
that
hain’t
done
just
right
is
always
the
very
ones
that
ain’t
the
most
anxious
to
pay
for
him
when
they’ve
got
their
satisfaction
out
of
him
.

i
am
mentally
deranged
,
not
normal
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
made
up
my
mind
to
let
him
stay
,
resolving
,
nevertheless
,
to
see
to
it
,
that
during
the
afternoon
he
had
to
do
with
my
less
important
papers
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
back
.
|
|
to
him
that
night
and
told
him
pap
was
here
again
,
for
i
found
his
tracks
in
the
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
talking
about
other
kings
,
and
let
solomon
slide
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
studying
it
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
and
got
the
bag
of
meal
and
my
old
saw
out
of
the
canoe
,
and
fetched
them
to
the
house
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
think
much
of
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
knowed
,
then
,
that
this
warn’t
pap
,
but
a
woman
dressed
up
in
a
man’s
clothes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
uncomfortable
again
.
|
|
|
full
of
trouble
,
full
as
i
could
be
;
and
didn’t
know
what
to
do
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
satisfied
,
and
said
we
would
waltz
in
on
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fixed
that
as
good
as
i
could
from
the
outside
by
scattering
dust
on
the
place
,
which
covered
up
the
smoothness
and
the
sawdust
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
the
gun
and
went
up
a
piece
into
the
woods
,
and
was
hunting
around
for
some
birds
when
i
see
a
wild
pig
;
hogs
soon
went
wild
in
them
bottoms
after
they
had
got
away
from
the
prairie
farms
.

my
paddle
and
slid
out
from
shore
just
a
step
or
two
,
and
then
let
the
canoe
drop
along
down
amongst
the
shadows
.

slipped
off
towards
where
i
had
run
across
that
camp
fire
,
stopping
every
minute
or
two
to
listen
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
set
there
and
watched
the
cannon-smoke
and
listened
to
the
boom
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
and
laid
for
him
to
wake
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
all
my
traps
into
my
canoe
again
so
as
to
have
them
out
of
sight
,
and
i
put
out
the
fire
and
scattered
the
ashes
around
to
look
like
an
old
last
year’s
camp
,
and
then
clumb
a
tree
.

give
it
a
shake
,
and
out
drops
a
little
piece
of
paper
with
“half-past
two”
wrote
on
it
with
a
pencil
.

told
you
i
was
expecting
trouble
myself
,
and
would
scatter
out
with
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
folks
i
reckoned
i
would
go
up
to
the
town
and
fetch
down
my
baggage
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
judged
i’d
got
to
do
the
other
thing—lay
for
them
and
eavesdrop
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
had
our
gang
in
a
pretty
tight
place
right
at
the
outstart
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
held
on
till
all
the
late
sounds
had
quit
and
the
early
ones
hadn’t
begun
yet
;
and
then
i
slipped
down
the
ladder
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tiptoed
along
,
and
got
down
stairs
all
right
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
come
down
the
ladder
and
started
for
down-stairs
;
but
as
i
come
to
the
girls’
room
the
door
was
open
,
and
i
see
mary
jane
setting
by
her
old
hair
trunk
,
which
was
open
and
she’d
been
packing
things
in
it—getting
ready
to
go
to
england
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wilted
right
down
on
to
the
planks
then
,
and
give
up
;
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
never
stopped
running
till
i
found
the
canoe
;
and
when
i
got
here
i
told
jim
to
hurry
,
or
they’d
catch
me
and
hang
me
yet
,
and
said
i
was
afeard
you
and
the
duke
wasn’t
alive
now
,
and
i
was
awful
sorry
,
and
so
was
jim
,
and
was
awful
glad
when
we
see
you
coming
;
you
may
ask
jim
if
i
didn’t
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
kneeled
down
.
|
|
|
just
took
a
look
,
and
shoved
along
,
straight
for
town
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
started
for
town
in
the
wagon
,
and
when
i
was
half-way
i
see
a
wagon
coming
,
and
sure
enough
it
was
tom
sawyer
,
and
i
stopped
and
waited
till
he
come
along
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
let
it
go
at
that
,
though
i
couldn’t
see
no
advantage
in
my
representing
a
prisoner
if
i
got
to
set
down
and
chaw
over
a
lot
of
gold-leaf
distinctions
like
that
every
time
i
see
a
chance
to
hog
a
watermelon
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
done
it
.
|
|
|
slips
to
the
sick-room
,
and
if
i
found
him
awake
i
reckoned
we
could
put
up
a
yarn
for
the
family
that
would
wash
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
if
i
prefer
the
service
and
cards
to
those
ideas
,
you
may
be
sure
i
have
good
grounds
for
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
don’t
give
them
notice
there
won’t
be
nobody
nor
nothing
to
interfere
with
us
,
and
so
after
all
our
hard
work
and
trouble
this
escape
‘ll
go
off
perfectly
flat
;
won’t
amount
to
nothing—won’t
be
nothing
to
it
.

long
as
you
can't
and
won't
renounce
what
underlies
it
all
,
your
chief
foe
,
your
devil—so
long
as
you
serve
that
slavishly
,
what
use
is
there
in
discussing
the
matter
seriously
?

there
is
only
one
thing
left
to
do
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ain’t
no
doubt
but
there
is
something
in
that
thing—that
is
,
there’s
something
in
it
when
a
body
like
the
widow
or
the
parson
prays
,
but
it
don’t
work
for
me
,
and
i
reckon
it
don’t
work
for
only
just
the
right
kind
.

i
was
!
|
|
had
to
stick
plumb
until
daylight
this
morning
;
and
i
never
see
a
nigger
that
was
a
better
nuss
or
faithfuller
,
and
yet
he
was
risking
his
freedom
to
do
it
,
and
was
all
tired
out
,
too
,
and
i
see
plain
enough
he’d
been
worked
main
hard
lately
.

passed
half
an
hour
.
|
|
|
|
|
when
i
look
out
of
the
train
window
at
petersburg
for
the
last
time
,
i
shall
say
,
'now
we
shall
settle
our
account
!

says
he
goes
to
our
church
,
she
says
:
“what—regular
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
good
and
dark
i
slid
out
from
shore
before
moonrise
and
paddled
over
to
the
illinois
bank—about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
see
the
raft
was
gone
and
we
flat
broke
,
there
warn’t
anything
for
it
but
to
try
the
royal
nonesuch
another
shake
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

he
sees
me
getting
the
canoe
ready
,
he
says
:
“well
,
then
,
if
you’re
bound
to
go
,
i’ll
tell
you
the
way
to
do
when
you
get
to
the
village
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
spent
a
whole
month
.
|
|
|
|
|
unhitched
a
skiff
and
pulled
down
the
river
two
mile
and
a
half
,
to
the
big
scar
on
the
hillside
,
and
went
ashore
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
back
and
got
the
canoe
,
and
paddled
up
abreast
the
cavern
,
and
lugged
all
the
traps
up
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a-quaking
and
shaking
down
the
stabboard
side
,
and
slow
work
it
was
,
too—seemed
a
week
before
we
got
to
the
stern
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
built
it
there
and
cooked
dinner
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
shortened
up
one
of
the
calico
gowns
,
and
i
turned
up
my
trouser-legs
to
my
knees
and
got
into
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
talked
it
over
all
one
night
,
drifting
along
down
the
river
,
trying
to
make
up
our
minds
whether
to
drop
the
watermelons
,
or
the
cantelopes
,
or
the
mushmelons
,
or
what
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slept
all
day
amongst
the
cottonwood
thicket
,
so
as
to
be
fresh
for
the
work
,
and
when
we
went
back
to
the
raft
about
dark
the
canoe
was
gone
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
shoved
out
after
dark
on
the
raft
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
put
in
the
day
,
lazying
around
,
listening
to
the
stillness
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
set
in
,
like
we
done
before
with
the
duke
,
and
tried
to
comfort
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
watching
,
and
by
and
by
he
stirs
a
bit
,
and
opened
his
eyes
very
natural
,
and
takes
a
look
,
and
says
:
“hello
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stayed
where
we
was
.
|
|
|
|
|
poked
along
back
home
,
and
i
warn’t
feeling
so
brash
as
i
was
before
,
but
kind
of
ornery
,
and
humble
,
and
to
blame
,
somehow—though
i
hadn’t
done
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cleared
out
for
the
house
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
allowed
we
would
steal
everything
there
was
that
come
handy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can’t
resk
being
as
long
digging
him
out
as
we
ought
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
dug
and
dug
with
the
case-knives
till
most
midnight
;
and
then
we
was
dog-tired
,
and
our
hands
was
blistered
,
and
yet
you
couldn’t
see
we’d
done
anything
hardly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
the
odd
spoon
,
and
dropped
it
in
her
apron-pocket
whilst
she
was
a-giving
us
our
sailing
orders
,
and
jim
got
it
all
right
,
along
with
her
shingle
nail
,
before
noon
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
put
the
sheet
back
on
the
line
that
night
,
and
stole
one
out
of
her
closet
;
and
kept
on
putting
it
back
and
stealing
it
again
for
a
couple
of
days
till
she
didn’t
know
how
many
sheets
she
had
any
more
,
and
she
didn’t
care
,
and
warn’t
a-going
to
bullyrag
the
rest
of
her
soul
out
about
it
,
and
wouldn’t
count
them
again
not
to
save
her
life
;
she
druther
die
first
.

was
all
right
now
,
as
to
the
shirt
and
the
sheet
and
the
spoon
and
the
candles
,
by
the
help
of
the
calf
and
the
rats
and
the
mixed-up
counting
;
and
as
to
the
candlestick
,
it
warn’t
no
consequence
,
it
would
blow
over
by
and
by

we
could
get
some
of
them
again
.
|

|

|
crept
to
the
door
,
and
tom
stopped
us
there
and
put
his
eye
to
the
crack
,
but
couldn’t
make
out
nothing
,
it
was
so
dark
;
and
whispered
and
said
he
would
listen
for
the
steps
to
get
further
,
and
when
he
nudged
us
jim
must
glide
out
first
,
and
him
last
.

turned
aside
to
the
bank
,
which
he
climbed
.

him
to
my

in
his
explanation
in

to
allow
the

time
to

the

undisturbed
.

traveler
,
took
him
by
the
arm
,
pointed
with
his
hand
at
the
condemned
man
,
who
stood
there
stiffly
now
that
the
attention
was
so
clearly
directed
at
him—the
soldier
was
also
pulling
on
his
chain—and
said
,
“the

grabbed
his
hands
,
turned
him
around
in
order
to
catch
his
gaze
,
and
asked
,
“do
you
see
the
shame
of
it
?

his
foot
back
and
let
himself
be
strapped
in
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
him
to
his
own
house
,
and
dressed
him
up
clean
and
nice
,
and
had
him
to
breakfast
and
dinner
and
supper
with
the
family
,
and
was
just
old
pie
to
him
,

watched
out
for
me
one
day
in
the
spring
,
and
catched
me
,
and
took
me
up
the
river
about
three
mile
in
a
skiff
,
and
crossed
over
to
the
illinois
shore
where
it
was
woody
and
there
warn’t
no
houses
but
an
old
log
hut
in
a
place
where
the
timber
was
so
thick
you
couldn’t
find
it
if
you
didn’t
know
where
it
was

off
pretty
soon
.

hadn’t
seen
anything
.
|
|
|
|
locked
me
in
and
took
the
skiff
,
and
started
off
towing
the
raft
about
half-past
three
.

didn’t
pry
into

pockets
,

only
felt
outside
with
his
hands
,
and
said
it
was
all
right
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

glided
along
,
and
the
powwow
and
racket
getting
more
and
more
outrageous
all
the
time
;
and
at
last
,
when
he
had
gone
around
two
sides
of
the
room
,
he
disappears
down
cellar
.

and
thought
,

pretty
soon
he
says
:
“it’s
all
right
;
i’ve
got
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
told
jim
how
we’d
have
to
smuggle
in
the
rope-ladder
pie
and
other
large
things
by
nat
,
the
nigger
that
fed
him
,
and
he
must
be
on
the
lookout
,
and
not
be
surprised
,
and
not
let
nat
see
him
open
them
;
and
we
would
put
small
things
in
uncle’s
coat-pockets
and
he
must
steal
them
out
;
and
we
would
tie
things
to
aunt’s
apron-strings
or
put
them
in
her
apron-pocket
,
if
we
got
a
chance
;
and
told
him
what
they
would
be
and
what
they
was
for
.

raised
up
his
bed
and
slid
the
chain
off
of
the
bed-leg
,
and
wrapt
it
round
and
round
his
neck
,
and
we
crawled
out
through
our
hole
and
down
there
,
and
jim
and
me
laid
into

set
his

to

crack
and
listened
,
and
listened
,
and
listened
,
and
the
steps
a-scraping
around
out
there
all
the
time
;
and
at
last
he
nudged
us
,
and
we
slid
out
,
and
stooped
down
,
not
breathing
,
and
not
making
the
least
noise
,
and
slipped
stealthy
towards
the
fence
in
injun
file
,
and
got
to
it
all
right
,
and
me
and
jim
over
it
;
but
tom’s
britches
catched
fast
on
a
splinter
on
the
top
rail
,
and
then
he
hear
the
steps
coming
,
so
he
had
to
pull
loose
,
which
snapped
the
splinter
and
made
a
noise
;

he
dropped
in

then
,
the
ringmaster
he
made
a
little
speech
,
and
said
he
hoped
there
wouldn’t
be
no
disturbance
,
and
if
the
man
would
promise
he
wouldn’t
make
no
more
trouble
he
would

all

called
him
cry-baby

that
made
him
mad
,

he

he

tell
all

secrets

i
felt
dreadful
glad
i’d
worked
it
all
off
on
to
the
niggers
,
and
yet
hadn’t
done
the
niggers
no
harm
by
it

dug
and
dug
like
everything
;
and
it
got
awful
dark
,
and
the
rain
started
,
and
the
wind
swished
and
swushed
along
,
and
the
lightning
come
brisker
and
brisker
,
and
the
thunder
boomed
;
but
them
people
never
took
no
notice
of
it
,
they
was
so
full
of
this
business
;
and
one
minute
you
could
see
everything
and
every
face
in
that
big
crowd
,
and
the
shovelfuls
of
dirt
sailing
up
out
of
the
grave
,
and
the
next
second
the
dark
wiped
it
all
out
,
and
you
couldn’t
see
nothing
at
all

then
i
judged
that
all
that
stuff
was
only
just
one
of
tom
sawyer’s
lies
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lit
out—for
bed
,
i
said
,
meaning
some
time
or
another
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
the
bearings
of
a
woody
island
that
was
down
the
river
a
piece
,
and
as
soon
as
it
was
fairly
dark
i
crept
out
with
my
raft
and
went
for
it
,
and
hid
it
there
,
and
then
turned
in
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
a
shovel
,
and
then
we
picked
and
shoveled
,
turn
about
,
and
made
the
fur
fly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
crept
into
a
lumber-pile
to
get
some
sleep
;
and
next
time
i
waked
up
the
sun
was
away
up
over
my
head
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
put
it
on
him
,
you
see
;
and
while
they
was
full
of
it
,
next
day
,
back
comes
old
finn
,
and
went
boo-hooing
to
judge
thatcher
to
get
money
to
hunt
for
the
nigger
all
over
illinois
with
.

waited
for
a
steamboat
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
looked
a
little
better
satisfied
,
and
says
:
“well
,
then
,
i’ll
believe
some
of
it
;
but
i
hope
to
gracious
if
i’ll
believe
the
rest

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
started
for
the
house
,
leading
me
by
the
hand
,
and
the
children
tagging
after
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
kissed
me
,
and
patted
me
on
the
head
,
and
dropped
into
a
kind
of
a
brown
study
;
and
pretty
soon
jumps
up
,
and
says
:
“why
,
lawsamercy
,
it’s
most
night
,
and
sid
not
come
yet

the
lawyer
turns
to
the
new
old
gentleman
and
says
:
“you
and
your
brother
please
write
a
line
or
two
and
sign
your
names
.

we
was
pretty
scared
,
and
made
up
an
agreement
that
we
wouldn’t
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
such
actions
,
and
if
we
ever
got
the
least
show
we
would
give
them
the
cold
shake
and
clear
out
and
leave
them
behind
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
away
and
went
to
the
rubbage-pile
in
the
back
yard
,
where
they
keep
the
old
boots
,
and
rags
,
and
pieces
of
bottles
,
and
wore-out
tin
things
,
and
all
such
truck
,
and
scratched
around
and
found
an
old
tin
washpan
,
and
stopped
up
the
holes
as
well
as
we
could
,
to
bake
the
pie
in
,
and
took
it
down
cellar
and
stole
it
full
of
flour
and
started
for
breakfast
,
and
found
a
couple
of
shingle-nails
that
tom
said
would
be
handy
for
a
prisoner
to
scrabble
his
name
and
sorrows
on
the
dungeon
walls
with
,
and
dropped
one
of
them
in
aunt
sally’s
apron-pocket
which
was
hanging
on
a
chair
,
and
t’other
we
stuck
in
the
band
of
uncle
silas’s
hat
,
which
was
on
the
bureau
,
because
we
heard
the
children
say
their
pa
and
ma
was
going
to
the
runaway
nigger’s
house
this
morning
,
and
then
went
to
breakfast
,
and
tom
dropped
the
pewter
spoon
in
uncle
silas’s
coat-pocket
,
and
aunt
sally
wasn’t
come
yet
,
so
we
had
to
wait
a
little
while
.

then
i’ll
go

of
a
yarn

get
somebody
to
go

by
we

him
in

little
low
doggery
,
very
tight
,
and
a
lot
of
loafers
bullyragging
him

they
got
just
about

laid
around

floated
along

thinking

never

what
he
would
probably
never
see
again
;
a
world
not
like
anything
else
,
a
world
in
which
the
moonlight
was
as
soft
and
beautiful
,
as
though
slumbering
here
in
its
cradle
,
where
there
was
no
life
,
none
whatever
;
but
in
every
dark
poplar
,
in
every
tomb
,
there
was
felt
the
presence
of
a
mystery
that
promised
a
life
peaceful
,
beautiful
,
eternal
.

wonderful

it

the

,
just

left
the

taken

i

that
the

have
contentedly
sat
down
with

an

i
stood

the
man
who
,
pipe
in

,
was
killed
one
cloudless
afternoon
long
ago
in
virginia
,
by
summer
lightning
;
at
his
own
warm
open
window
he
was
killed
,

remained
leaning
out
there
upon

afternoon

up

about

hove

i
stood
behind

down

little
after
ten
,

took
one
of
the
candles
along
,
and
listened
under
the
window-hole

heard
jim

we

february
the
sun
shone
during
the
days
and
ice
formed
at
night—slick
sheets
glazing
the
wheat
fields
,
the
roofs

enough

a
good
thirty
years

day

notion
,
too
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
how
she
had
found
out
the
secret
:
but
she
liked
the
review
immensely

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
very
well
;
but
now
comes
the
tragic
part
about
johnny
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
right
as
far
as
it
went
,
but
the
towhead
warn’t
sixty
yards
long
,
and
the
minute
i
flew
by
the
foot
of
it
i
shot
out
into
the
solid
white
fog
,
and
hadn’t
no
more
idea
which
way
i
was
going
than
a
dead
man
.

they
asked
me
.

|
|
|
fixed
.
|
|
|
because
the
sun
was
absent
from
the
sky
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
why
he
had
jumped
away
so
suddenly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
good
enough
for
the
officer
,
for
now
he
could
explain
the
apparatus
himself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
!
|
|
always
his
word
.
|
|
|
|
somebody
else’s
whoop
,
or
else
i
was
turned
around
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
where
it
pinched

|
|
|
|
his
style—he
never
give
anybody
a
chance

bright—it
was
right
down
bully
;

it
was
the
thing
that
saved
us

|
|

|
|
|

my
fix
exactly
.

|
|
|
the
thing
that
was
too
many
for
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
keep
witches
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
of
course
,
is
better
than
if
you
were
satisfied
,
slept
soundly
,
and
thought
everything
was
satisfactory
.

|
|
|
|
|

not
fit
in
with
the
legend

the
goal
towards
which
all
divinely
endowed
,
noble
natures
strive

your

sounded
pretty
reasonable
,
so
i
didn’t
say
no
more
;
but
i
couldn’t
keep
from
studying
over
it
and
wishing
i
knowed
who
shot
the
man
,
and
what
they
done
it
for
.

all
comes
of
my
being

a
fool

not

its

the

young
girl
screamed
out
and
comes
rushing
,
and
down
she
throws
herself
on
her
father
,
crying
,
and
saying
,
“oh

he’s

he’s

|

|
|
old
gentleman
that
had
just
come
looked
all
puzzled
to
death
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fool
had
made
a
trade
and
got
forty
dollars
,
and
when
we
found
him
in
the
doggery
the
loafers
had
matched
half-dollars
with
him
and
got
every
cent
but
what
he’d
spent
for
whisky
;
and
when
i
got
him
home
late
last
night
and
found
the
raft
gone
,
we
said
,
‘that
little
rascal
has
stole
our
raft
and
shook
us
,
and
run
off
down
the
river
.

muleheaded
old
fool
wouldn’t
give
in
then
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
help
me
much
,
though
;
for
i
didn’t
know
the

down

twin
curtains
of

appeared
in
the
north
,
white
all
the
way
to
the
sky
,
driving
south
like

end

galloped
the

bawling
.

trees
toppled
;
a
barn
roof
tumbled
over
the
highway
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
but
the
hunter
watched
only
the
girl
;
she
was
graceful
,
young
,
smiling
.

|

|
|

|
|
|
|
next
winter
vespucci
brought
her
back
to
great
falls

sawed
her
in
half
in

plywood
coffin
.

i
went
exploring
around
down
through

island
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nature
of
death
is
not
at
all
final
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
only
thing
they
would
not
stand
was
back
answers
.

|
legend
interests
me
.
|
|
|
|
thought
that
he
read
in
the
book
did
not
satisfy
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
returned
and
continued
,
until
he
could
picture
his
body
totally
frozen
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cigar
left
a
bitter
and
disgusting
taste
in
his
mouth
,
and
the
wine
had
not
the
same
flavour
as
it
had
the
year
before
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

day
before
,
when
during
a
quarrel
he
had
cried
out
in
a
tearful
voice
,
"my
god
,
when
will
it
end
?
|
|
|

|
|
|

sun
rose
and
i
grew
happier
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
watch
had
disappeared
completely
.
|
|
|
|
|
point
is
,
why
haven't
you
been
sincere
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fault
is
neither
yours
nor
mine
;
we
are
of
too
little
consequence
to
affect
the
destiny
of
a
whole
generation
.
|

|
|

tem-
perature
did
not
matter
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
animal
sensed
the
danger
.
|
|
|
|
|
man
knew
these
things
,
having
learned
them
from
expe-
rience
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
whistled
,
and
spoke
to
it
with
the
sound
of
the
whip
in
his
voice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
remained
silent
.
|
|
|
|
dog
knew
and
all
of
its
family
knew
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
blood
in
wet
and
freezing
feet
cannot
be
kept
moving
by
running
when
it
is
75
degrees
below
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
instant
he
stopped
,
the
action
of
the
heart
slowed
down
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
awful
cold
had
already
driven
the
life
out
of
his
fingers
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
burning
smell
went
up
his
nose
,
causing
him
to
cough
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
boys
would
take
care
of
him
and
save
the
rest
of
him
when
he
got
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
new
commandant
has
excused
himself
from
this
honourable
duty
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lenient
administration
has
a
different
opinion
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
movements
of
his
thick
pouting
lips
showed
clearly
that
he
was
incapable
of
understanding
anything
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
officer
held
the
traveler
firmly
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
he
took
a
lump
of
earth
from
the
wall
and
threw
it
at
the
soldier
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
grasped
him
by
the
hand
and
pulled
him
aside
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
commandant
doesn’t
really
need
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
old
man
got
pretty
silent
by
and
by—didn’t
have
much
to
say
,
and
didn’t
look
pretty
comfortable
over
all
that
petting
that
was
going
on
around
that
duke
.

duke
kind
of
soured
on
him
,
and
didn’t
look
a
bit
satisfied
with
the
way
things
was
going
;
still
,
the
king
acted
real
friendly
towards
him
,
and
said
the
duke’s
great-grandfather
and
all
the
other
dukes
of
bilgewater
was
a
good
deal
thought
of
by
his
father
,
and
was
allowed
to
come
to
the
palace
considerable
;
but
the
duke
stayed
huffy
a
good
while
,
till
by
and
by
the
king
says
:
“like
as
not
we
got
to
be
together
a
blamed
long
time
on
this
h-yer
raft
,
bilgewater
,
and
so
what’s
the
use
o’
your
bein’
sour
?

looked

says

and
so
they
all
come
and
shook
hands
with
the
king
and
thanked
him
and
talked
to
him
;
and
then
they
shook
hands
with
the
duke
and
didn’t
say
nothing
,
but
just
kept
a-smiling
and
bobbing
their
heads
like
a
passel
of
sapheads
whilst
he
made
all
sorts
of
signs
with
his
hands
and
said
“goo-goo—goo-goo-goo”

i
couldn’t

done
that
in

again
excited

mood
was

the
long

hot
african
veldt-the
awful
death
in

jaws
of

lion
.

time
i
found
something
at
last
;
i
found
an
old
rusty
wood-saw
without
any
handle
;
it
was
laid
in
between
a
rafter
and
the
clapboards
of

somehow
got
to
talking
to
him
about
his

ones
;
and
by
and
by
he
says
:
“what

one
was
a
staving
dream

tell
me
all
about
it

jim

all
they
did
was
jump
.
|
|
|
|
|
these
were
only
dreams
,
in
reality
there
was
only
one
thing
left
to
do—to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
,
not
to
stay
another
hour
in
this
place
.

this
hard
labour
passed
unnoticed
as
though
in
a
fog
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
quiet
.
|
|
|
this—the
distant
trail
,
no
sun
in
the
sky
,
the
great
cold
,
and
the
strangeness
of
it
all—had
no
effect
on
the
man
.

they
were
relentless
:
a
grieving
widow
,
an
orphan's
lawyer
,
a
reporter
from
the
great
falls
tribune
.

friends
of

years'

and
their
careers
had
been
parallel
,
first
at
the
university
and
then
as

he
could
not
risk
a
grandiose
phrase
with

sailed
into
digging
anyway
by
the
flicker
of
the
lightning
,
and
sent
a
man
to
the
nearest
house
,
a
half
a
mile
off
,
to
borrow
one

all
locked
and
chained
;
so
he
took
my
canoe
,
and
said
for
me
to
wait
till
he
come
back
,
or
i
could
hunt
around
further
,
or
maybe
i
better
go
down
home

get
them

in

we

much
to
celebrate

the
flowers
along
the
avenues
,
and
here
and
there
in
the
flower-beds
,
were
enough
to
make
one
feel
,
as
one
walked
about
the
garden
,
as
though
one
were
in
a
realm
of
tender
colours
,
especially
in
the
early
morning

sleeping
very

it
warn’t
no

nothing
but
to
be
dead
and
done
with
it
all
could
do
him
any
good
;
though
he
said
it
often
made
him
feel
easier
and
better
for
a
while
if
people
treated
him
according
to
his
rights
,
and
got
down
on
one
knee
to
speak
to
him
,
and
always
called
him
“your
majesty
,”
and
waited
on
him
first
at
meals

down

shook
himself
free

you

knew
also
that
there
were
streams
of
water
that
came
out
from

ran
along

on

it

tom

he’d
got
to
;
there
warn’t
no
case
of
a

scrabbling
his

it
away
and

to
think
of
other
things
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ran
no
more
than
100
feet
,
when
he
fell
head
first
.

mollified
me
by
making
an
oriental
bow
,
and
saying—“with
submission

sir

it

generous
of
me
to
find
you
in

mechanically

blankly
declined

seemed
alone

absolutely
alone
in
the
universe

kept
pulling
his
hand
back
startled
,
for
immediately
another
wheel
followed
,
which
,
at

in
its
initial
rolling
,
surprised
him

what
i
was
at
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
never
meddled
at
all
;
just
slid
the
lid
along
as
soft
as
mush
,
and
screwed
it
down
tight
and
fast
.

took
the
pen
and

sighed
,
and
pretty
soon
he
stopped
digging
,
and
then
for
a
good
little
while
i
knowed
that
he
was
thinking
.

it
over

then
said
jim

along
the
best
he
could
with
an
onion

put
his
foot
on
the

rocked
her

shook
his

we’d

running
her
into
a
little
creek
like
a
gully
,
all
hung
over
with
vines
and
willows
,
i
struck
another
idea
:
i
judged
i’d
hide
her
good
,
and
then
,
‘stead
of
taking
to
the
woods
when
i
run
off
,
i’d
go
down
the
river
about
fifty
mile
and
camp
in
one
place
for
good
,
and
not
have
such
a
rough
time
tramping
on

she
had
no
right
to
call
him
a
west
briton
before
people
,
even
in
joke
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
only
to
go
out
of
the
house
for
me
to
find
excuses
and
explanations
for
everything
,
and
to
be
waiting
eagerly
for
the
hall
porter
to
ring
for
me
.

stopped
now
with
a
folded
gown
in
her
lap
,
and
had
her
face
in
her
hands
,
crying
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
never
would
be
said
by
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
did
not
seem
to
be
in
ill
humour
:
she
had
gone
away
laughing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
silent
,
perhaps
waiting
for
him
to
speak
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
on
my
mind
and
tom
was
on
my
mind
,
so
i
slept
very
restless
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
has
turned
my
life
upside
down
;
what
i
have
regarded
as
trivial
and
nonsensical
till
now
she
has
forced
me
to
raise
to
the
level
of
a
serious
problem
;
i
serve
an
idol
whom
i
have
never
looked
upon
as
god
.

|
wouldn’t
.
|
|
watched
for
a
chance
,
and
directly
banged
away
at
a
rat
;
but
she
missed
him
wide
,
and
said
“ouch
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

broke
off
to
say
:
“keep
your
eye
on
the
rats
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
come
.
|
|
|
counted
and
counted
till
she
got
that
addled
she’d
start
to
count
in
the
basket
for
a
spoon
sometimes
;
and
so
,
three
times
they
come
out
right
,
and
three
times
they
come
out
wrong
.

said
she’d
set
up
for
him
a
while
anyway
,
and
keep
a
light
burning
so
he
could
see
it
.

it's
not

,
mary
jane
,
and
it's
not
right
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
quite
a
disinterested
trick
of
the
spirits
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
nonsense

|
|
|
staying
locked
until
i
find
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there's
such
a
thing
as
common
everyday
politeness
and
gratitude
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
suppose
none
of
you
ever
heard
of
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
will
tell
you
,
my
dear
fellow
,
the
worst
enemy
in
the
garden
is
not
a
hare
,
not
a
cockchafer
,
and
not
the
frost
,
but
any
outside
person
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can't
tell
you
all
about
it
or
you
would
call
me
mad
and
not
believe
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
grew
accustomed
to
it
in
time
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can
do
two
things
at
once—read
and
listen
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
must
own
i
am
a
little
overwhelmed
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
laugh
because
i
can't
believe
in
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

am
ashamed
,
anyway
,
that
you
should
be
troubled
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
particular
.
|
|
|
|
have
kept
it
.
|
|
|
|
waive
the
biographies
of
all
other
scriveners
for
a
few
passages
in
the
life
of
bartleby
,
who
was
a
scrivener
the
strangest
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
.

thought
it
prudent
not

break
the
dismission
at
once
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cannot
stop
longer
.
|
|
|
|
don't
see
anything
wrong
.
|
|
|
|
|
never
said
so
,
because
it
would
only
make
trouble
,
and
wouldn’t
do
no
good
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
.
|
|
nothing
,
never
let
on
;
kept
it
to
myself
;
it’s
the
best
way
;
then
you
don’t
have
no
quarrels
,
and
don’t
get
into
no

luck
somehow

i

dasn’t

a

|
|

said
no
;
he
might
wake
and
make
a
disturbance
,
and
then
they’d
find
out
i
warn’t
in
.
|

come
on

if
we
get
left

we
are

sure

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
leave
it
alone
till
by
and
by
;
and
told
his
driver
to
wait
,
and
we
drove
off
a
little
piece
,
and
i
told
him
the
kind
of
a
fix
i
was
in
,
and
what
did
he
reckon
we
better
do
?

maybe
we
might
think
we
was
passing
the
foot
of
an
island
and
coming
into
the
same
old
river
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
didn’t
;
so
i
told
him
just
how
to
find
the
raft
,
and
then
he
started
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
warn’t

long
,
because
i
happened
to
think
of
something
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
couldn’t
see
no
profit
in
it
.
|
|

|

set
still
long
.
|
|
|
|
come
to
nothing
.
|
|

|
get
no
show
,
mrs
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
make
out
how
he
was
willing
to
go
into
this
thing
;
so
i
just
let
it
go
,
and
never
bothered
no
more
about
it

:
“please

|
|
|
|
|
|

|

,
i
got
to
do
it—i

out

it
.

s’pose
we’ve

to
.
|
|
|
|
|
made
out
to
see
that
the
drift
of
the
current
was
towards
the
left-hand
shore
,
which
meant
that
i
was
in
a
crossing
;
so
i
changed
off
and
went
that
way
.

|
|
|
|
|

reckoned
that
with
her
disposition
she
was
having
a
better
time
in
the
graveyard
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
about
as
well
the
way
it
was
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
warn
you
all
that
a
time
‘s
coming
when
you’re
going
to
feel
sick
whenever
you
think
of
this
day
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
do
it
pretty
good
,
and
when
i
got
done
i
see
she
warn’t
satisfied
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
straight
off
,
but
laid
the
paper
down
and
set
there
thinking—thinking
how
good
it
was
all
this
happened
so
,
and
how
near
i
come
to
being
lost
and
going
to
hell
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
want
to
run
the
raft
in
the
daytime
without
anybody
aboard
to
answer
questions
but
me
;
so
i
didn’t
want
the
plan
to
begin
working
till
pretty
late
to-night
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
see
no
joke
about
it
,
and
i
judged
it
would
strain
the
duke
and
the
king
some
to
see
any
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

mind
,
because
i
didn’t
want
to
see
nobody
just
yet—i
only
wanted
to
get
the
lay
of
the
land
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
better
hive
it
tonight
if
i
can
,
because
the
doctor
maybe
hasn’t
let
up
as
much
as
he
lets
on
he
has
;
he
might
scare
them
out
of
here
yet
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
i
couldn’t
do
nothing
without
a
candle
,
and
i
dasn’t
light
one
,
of
course
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bet
she
done
it
,
just
the
same—she
was
just
that
kind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
soon
give
up
that
notion
for
two
things
:
she’d
be
mad
and
disgusted
at
his
rascality
and
ungratefulness
for
leaving
her
,
and
so
she’d
sell
him
straight
down
the
river
again
;
and
if
she
didn’t
,
everybody
naturally
despises
an
ungrateful
nigger
,
and
they’d
make
jim
feel
it
all
the
time
,
and
so
he’d
feel
ornery
and
disgraced
.

knowed
i
could
tire
him
out
at
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they’d
make
trouble
,
and
i
thought
if
you
warn’t
in
no
hurry
,
i’d—”
“well
,
you
do
need
skinning
,
there
ain’t
no
mistake
about
it

go
a
good
deal
on
instinct
;
and
my
instinct
said
she
would
be
coming
up—from
down
towards
orleans
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

don’t
care
,
i
don’t
mind
the
terms—i’d
be
willing
to
stand
a
thousand
such
jokes
to
have
you
here
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
plenty
time
.
|
|
|
|
reckon
i
got
to
light
out
for
the
territory
ahead
of
the
rest
,
because
aunt
sally
she’s
going
to
adopt
me
and
sivilize
me
,
and
i
can’t
stand
it
.

|
|
|
|
granted
even
that
,
it
is
,
to
my
mind
,
a
princely
failing
,
and
one
that
i
trust
will
long
be
cultivated
among
us
.

we
are
living
in
a
sceptical
and
,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
,
a
thought-tormented
age
:
and
sometimes
i
fear
that
this
new
generation
,
educated
or
hypereducated
as
it
is
,
will
lack
those
qualities
of
humanity
,
of
hospitality
,
of
kindly
humour
which
belonged
to
an
older
day

in
,
and
all
the
other
things
;
and
you
never
see
a
cabin
as
blithesome
as
jim’s
was
when
they’d
all
swarm
out
for
music
and
go
for
him
.

under
all
right
,
and
out
through
the
hole
,
swift
but
soft—jim
first
,
me
next
,
and
tom
last
,
which
was
according
to
tom’s
orders
.

didn’t
see
no
rafts
laying
up
;
so
we
went
along
during
three
hours
and
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wait
.
|
|

don’t
want
to
be
the
laughing
stock
of
this
whole
town
,
i
reckon
,
and
never
hear
the
last
of
this
thing
as
long
as
we
live
.

can’t
fool
along
;
we
got
to
rush
;
we
ain’t
got
no
time
to
spare
.

now
,
after
the
kindling
again
of
so
many
memories
,
the
first
touch
of
her
body
,
musical
and
strange
and
perfumed
,
sent
through
him
a
keen
pang
of
lust
.
|

|

|
|
|

,
this
bake
oven
with
murder
in
the
heat
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
let
us
part
.
|
|
|
|
four
years
had
passed
.
|
|
|
|
|
some
one
young
has
come
;
perhaps
she
will
be
more
fortunate
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
sank
down
into
the
lowest
depths
of
his
body
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
did
;
and
it
stayed
with
me
,
and
scorched
me
more
and
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
have
him
,
and
i
won’t
release
him
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
could
no
longer
reach
the
crank
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
two
men
could
not
make
up
their
mind
whether
to
come
or
not
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
says
:
“honey
,
i
thought
you
said
it
was
sarah
when
you
first
come
in
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
every
fresh
meeting
with
an
interesting
woman
this
experience
seemed
to
slip
out
of
his
memory
,
and
he
was
eager
for
life
,
and
everything
seemed
simple
and
amusing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
no
other
time
is
stepan
stepanitch
so
reasonable
,
virtuous
,
stern
or
just
as
at
dinner
,
when
all
his
household
are
sitting
about
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
same
time
she
remembered
that
i
was
a
flunkey
,
a
being
of
a
lower
order
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
last
they
allowed
me
to
go
out
on
the
balcony
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
just
as
i
was
sailing
by
,
flash
comes
the
light
in
mary
jane’s
window
!
|

|

|
|
|

that
point
the
harrow
was
already
moving
upwards
and
to
the
side
,
with
the
skewered
body—just
as
it
did
in
other
cases
,
but
only
in
the
twelfth
hour
.

|

|
|
|

supper
,
at
night
,
one
of
the
little
boys
says
:
“pa
,
mayn’t
tom
and
sid
and
me
go
to
the
show
?
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
this
case
there
was
still
the
diffidence
,
the
angularity
of
inexperienced
youth
,
an
awkward
feeling
;
and
there
was
a
sense
of
consternation
as
though
some
one
had
suddenly
knocked
at
the
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
his
home
it
was
impossible
to
talk
of
his
love
,
and
he
had
no
one
outside
;
he
could
not
talk
to
his
tenants
nor
to
any
one
at
the
bank
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

relations
with
zinaida
fyodorovna
he
displayed
for
some
reason
,
even
in
trifles
,
an
obstinacy
which
sometimes
was
almost
irrational
.

|
|

was
a
strange
note
of
fear
that
frightened
the
animal
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
quite
as
clear
a
one
came
the
previous
reply
,
“i
would
prefer
not
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
great
contrast
to
this
care
,
as
soon
he
was
finished
handling
an
article
of
clothing
,
he
immediately
flung
it
angrily
into
the
hole
.

a
little
while
i
see
a
pale
streak
over
the
treetops
,
and
knowed
the
day
was
coming
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
more
than
a
month
passed
,
real
winter
had
come
,
and
everything
was
still
clear
in
his
memory
as
though
he
had
parted
with
anna
sergeyevna
only
the
day
before
.
|

how
far
they
were
still
from
the
end
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
?
|
quiet
the
man
becomes
around
the
sixth
hour
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
am
supposed
to
get
the
machine
to
work
in
the
meantime
without
a
strap—no
one’s
concerned
about
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
will
the
commandant
take
them
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
you
goin’
to
manage
it
this
time
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
what
are
the
profits
,
and
how
do
they
enjoy
them
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
it
for
?
|
|
|
|
made
the
garden
most
cheerful
and
gave
it
a
lively
air
,
was
the
continual
coming
and
going
in
it
,
from
early
morning
till
evening
;
people
with
wheelbarrows
,
shovels
,
and
watering-cans
swarmed
round
the
trees
and
bushes
,
in
the
avenues
and
the
flower-beds
,
like
ants
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

a
pale
,
fearfully
pale
,
thin
face
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
restless
,
jerky
tone
!
|
|
|
|
|
wicked
,
angry
face
you
have
!

|
|
|

is
the
matter
with
you
?
|
|
|
|
use
of
talking
!
|
|
|
|
|

would
she
have
said
if
she
found
out
the
actual
truth
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
above
everything
revolted
him
and
moved
him
to
indignation
was
the
expression
of
happiness
on
his
wife's
face
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
could
he
be
doing
there
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
you
do
say
must
be
short
and
vague
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
say
is
this
:
it
ain’t
good
sense
to
go
court’n
around
after
a
halter
if
you
can
git
at
what
you’re
up
to
in
some
way
that’s
jist
as
good
and
at
the
same
time
don’t
bring
you
into
no
resks
.

did
become
of
the
raft
,
then
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that's
only
apparent
:
she
is
only
the
figurehead
.

you've
no

still

don't
you

i’m

be

for
mr

,
of

,
i
count
on

you
want
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
my
dear
,
the
real
point
on
which
the
whole
legend
hangs
lies
in
the
fact
that
,
exactly
a
thousand
years
from
the
day
when
the
monk
walked
in
the
desert
,
the
mirage
will
return
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
again
and
will
appear
to
men
.

why

you

|

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
with
all
his
rubbing
,
the
instant
he
stopped

his
face

became
numb
.

sir

as

saying

if

interrupted

“you

being

he
had
paid
it
no
attention
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
one
day
a
letter
in
a
light
blue
envelope
was
brought
him
from
the
town
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wants
to
live
apart
from
future
generations
and
not
only
for
their
sake

afternoon
the
evil
impulse
in
me
mastered
me
,
and
the
following
little
scene
ensued
:
53
“bartleby
,”
said
i
,
“when
those
papers
are
all
copied
,
i
will
compare
them
with
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
her
migraine
that
he
visited
the
turkins'
now
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
surprising
,
the
rapidity
with
which
his
face
and
nose
were
freezing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
he
could
do
:
hold
its
body
encircled
in
his
arms
and
sit
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pointing
to
where
the
traveler
was
standing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
too
late
.
|
|
dark
to
see
yet
,
so
we
made
the
canoe
fast
and
set
in
her
to
wait
for
daylight
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|

something
else
.

|
a
mistake

aunt
sally
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
turned
out
to
be
an
inconvenient
moment
,
as
ekaterina
ivanovna
was
in
her
own
room
having
her
hair
done
by
a
hair-dresser
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
is
difficult
to
strike
a
match
against
a
crumbling
stone
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
too
late
.
|
|
|
|
had
not
been
as
cold
as
this
,
he
knew
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
been
eas-
ier
to
pull
the
sticks
from
the
bushes
and
drop
them
directly
on
the
fire
.

|
|

did
not

jack
london
matter
much
,
he
decided
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
not
come
to
the
man
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
may
only
be
a
passing
whim
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
appears
i
am
deceived
.
|
|
|
|
|
dropped
upon
the
floor
,
and
then
,—strange
to
say—i
tore
myself
from
him
whom
i
had
so
longed
to
be
rid
of
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

warn’t
so
.
|
this
time
.
|
|
|
|
no
use
;
he
said
it
wouldn’t
talk
.
|
|
|
|
|
stormed
right
along

any
man
that
pretended
to
be
an
englishman

no

what

judgment
,
because
that
was
the
boot
that
had
a
couple
of
his
toes
leaking
out
of
the
front
end
of
it
;
so
now
he
raised
a
howl
that
fairly
made
a
body’s
hair
raise
,
and
down
he
went
in
the
dirt
,
and
rolled
there
,
and
held
his
toes
;
and
the
cussing
he
done
then
laid
over
anything
he
had
ever
done
previous

;
because
he
warn’t
only
just
a
farmer
,
he
was
a
preacher
,
too
,
and
had
a
little
one-horse
log
church
down
back
of
the
plantation
,
which
he
built
it
himself
at
his
own
expense
,
for
a
church
and
schoolhouse
,

never
charged
nothing
for
his

two

she

tell

i

at

a

after

he
got
up
half
way
about
three
times
,
and
missed
fire
and
fell
every
time
,
and
the
last
time
most
busted
his
brains
out
,
he
thought
he’d
got
to
give
it
up
;
but
after
he
was
rested
he
allowed
he
would
give
her
one
more
turn
for
luck

that
we
was

right

was
the
sudden

it

knocked
us
so
kind
of
cold
.

half

was
it
?

|
|
of
that
later
.

the
change
that
had
taken
place
in

i
did
not

word

|
|
|

course
i
forgot
all
about
driving
slow
on
accounts
of
being
glad
and
full
of
thinking
;
so
i
got
home
a
heap

quick

length
of

we
thought
of
the
right
way
at
last—which
was
to
cook
the
ladder
,
too
,
in
the
pie
.

ask

orlov

his

did
not
jeer

make

,
they
talked
ironically

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

again
some
one
rang

obeying
that
wondrous
ascendancy
which
the
inscrutable
scrivener
had
over
me
,
and
from
which
ascendency
,
for
all
my
chafing
,
i
could
not
completely
escape
,
i
slowly
went
down
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
,
and
while
walking
round
the
block
,
considered
what
i
should
next
do
in
this
unheard-of
perplexity

|
|
|

|

soon
the
book
dropped
from
his
hand
,
he
turned
heavily
in
his
chair
,
and
again
screened
his
eyes
as
though
from
the
sun

were
vain

|
|
|
|
|
her
eyes
looked
piteous
as
a
fawn's
,
her
shoulders
seemed
to
droop
,
her
lips
were
moving
,
and
i
went
away
again
without
saying
a
word
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
face
was
contorted
with
pain
;
she
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
,
as
though
wondering
what
was
happening
to
her
.
|
|
|

|
|

what's
the
good
of
talking
?
|
|
|
|
use
of
talking
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
instead
of
acting
,
i
looked
quite
unconcernedly
,
first
at
his
bald
patch
and
then
at
his
fur
,
and
calmly
meditated
on
this
man's
relation
to
his
only
son
,
and
on
the
fact
that
people
spoiled
by
power
and
wealth
probably
don't
want
to
die
.

before
going
i
hurriedly
sat
down
and
began
writing
to
orlov
:
"i

my
false

i
began
.

it

night
they
changed
around
and
judged
it
was
done
by
a
runaway
nigger
named
jim

up

cornered

she
could
break
it
open
she
dropped
it
and
run—for
she
see
something

my
mind
and
heart
are
burning
,
and
i
go
on
writing
;
for
some
reason
i
am
moved
as
though
this
letter
still
might
save
you
and
me
.

me

|
|

guess
is
that
with
you
he
is
exposing
me
to
the
judgment
of
a
respected
foreigner
.

who

my

now
?

|
|
|
as
you
like
.
|
|
|
it
was
,
i
should
have
as
soon
thought
of
turning
my
pale
plaster-of-paris
bust
of
cicero
out
of

reached
the

the

at
once
cast

her
spirit
was
inexhaustible
.

exactly
how
much
colder
he
did
not
know
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
no
feeling
was
created
in
his
hands
.
|
|

;
he
insisted
upon
his
afternoon
devotions
.
|

invention
would
answer
.
|

,
nary
a

did
they
turn
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
with
all
his
failings
,
and
the
annoyances
he
caused
me
,
nippers
,
like
his
compatriot
turkey
,
was
a
very
useful
man
to
me
;
wrote
a
neat
,
swift
hand
;
and
,
when
he
chose
,
was
not
deficient
in
a
gentlemanly
sort
of
deportment
.

while
the
hat
was
a
thing
of
indifference
to
me
,
inasmuch
as
his
natural
civility
and
deference
,
as
a
dependent
englishman
,
always
led
him
to
doff
it
the
moment
he
entered
the

his

elexander
phelps
found
it
there
,
and
opened
the
door
of
it
to
see
if
the
rats
would
come
out
,
and
they
did
;
and
aunt
sally
she
come
in
,
and
when
we
got
back
she
was
a-standing
on

of
the
bed
raising
cain

and
the

was
doing

indeed
,
nature
herself
seemed
to
have
been
his
vintner
,
and
at
his
birth
charged
him
so
thoroughly
with
an
irritable
,
brandy-like
disposition
,
that
all
subsequent
potations
were
needless
.

there
was
something
about
bartleby
that
not
only
strangely
disarmed
me
,
but
in
a
wonderful
manner
touched
and
disconcerted
me
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

no

warn’t
no
spaniards
and
a-rabs
,
and
there
warn’t
no
camels
nor
no
elephants
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
getting
away
,
you
know
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
time
to
swap
knives
;
the
old
man
grabbed
me
by
the
hand
and
shook
,
and
kept
on
shaking
;
and
all
the
time
how
the
woman
did
dance
around
and
laugh
and
cry
;
and
then
how
they
both
did
fire
off
questions
about
sid
,
and
mary
,
and
the
rest
of
the
tribe
.

once
more
business
hurried
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
upon
the
whole
,
as
it
was
drawing
towards
my
dinner-hour
,
i
thought
it
best
to
put
on
my
hat
and
walk
home
for
the
day
,
suffering
much
from
perplexity
and
distress
of
mind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
second
thoughts
the
success
of
the
plan
seemed
rather
dubious
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
without
sundry
twinges
of
impotent
rebellion
against
the
mild
effrontery
of
this
unaccountable
scrivener
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
for
long
.
|
|
|
very
different
.
|
|
|
long
,
because
she
says
:
“it’s
just
as
i
expected
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
feeling
brash
.
|
|
|
|
thus
it
often
is
,
that
the
constant
friction
of
illiberal
minds
wears
out
at
last
the
best
resolves
of
the
more
generous
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
having
taken
three
days
to
meditate
upon
it
,
he
apprised
me
that
his
original
determination
remained
the
same
;
in
short
,
that
he
still
preferred
to
abide
with
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
these
fears
were
needless
.
|
|
|
|
|
coming
to
my
room
the
day
after
,
i
found
several
persons
waiting
at
my
door
in
a
high
state
of
nervous
excitement
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nothing
stirred
.
|
|
did
.
|
|
come
of
it
;
the
faces
didn’t
tell
me
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ere
parting
with
the
reader
,
let
me
say
,
that
if
this
little
narrative
has
sufficiently
interested
him
,
to
awaken
curiosity
as
to
who
bartleby
was
,
and
what
manner
of
life
he
led
prior
to
the
present
narrator’s
making
his
acquaintance
,
i
can
only
reply
,
that
in
such
curiosity
i
fully
share
,
but
am
wholly
unable
to
gratify
it
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
inasmuch
as
this
vague
report
has
not
been
without
a
certain
strange
suggestive
interest
to
me
,
however
sad
,
it
may
prove
the
same
with
some
others
;
and
so
i
will
briefly
mention
it
.

it’s
the
harrow
which
has
the
job
of
actually
carrying
out
the
sentence
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
kind
of
slow
,
and
takes
a
long
time
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

jis’
as

gone
,
that’s
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
,
and
you’ll
just
have
to
change
to
a
red
flann’l
one
till
i
can
get
time
to
make
a
new
one
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
time
is
passing
.
|
|
|
|
tomorrow
,
once
the
apparatus
is
clean
again—the
fact
that
it
gets
so
very
dirty
is
its
only
fault—i
could
add
a
detailed
explanation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
then
the
harrow
spits
him
right
out
and
throws
him
into
the
pit
,
where
he
splashes
down
into
the
bloody
water
and
cotton
wool
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there’s
no
time
to
lose
.
|
|
|
|
hope
that
he’s
come
;
for
he
couldn’t
come
and
me
miss
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
one
thing—he
can
have
a
rope
ladder
;
we
can
tear
up
our
sheets
and
make
him
a
rope
ladder
easy
enough
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thing
,
anyway—jim’s
too
old
to
be
dug
out
with
a
case-knife
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
always
somebody
spying
around
that
gives
notice
to
the
governor
of
the
castle
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
back
then
the
needles
which
made
the
inscription
dripped
a
caustic
liquid
which
we
are
not
permitted
to
use
any
more
today
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
assuming
you’re
right
,
doesn’t
saving
this
whole
procedure
require
one
to
try
even
those
methods
which
may
be
inadequate
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
should
you
for
some
inexplicable
reason
still
not
be
invited
,
you
must
make
sure
you
request
an
invitation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
perhaps
you
don’t
want
to
do
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
finally
he
said
,
as
he
had
to
,
“no
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
everything
was
quiet
,
without
the
slightest
audible
hum
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
already
up
on
the
inscriber
another
gear
wheel
was
moving
upwards
.

|
|
|
|
|

we'll
make
good
children
out
of

wait
and

tom
sawyer
he
hunted
me
up
and
said
he
was
going
to
start
a
band
of
robbers
,
and
i
might
join
if
i
would
go
back
to
the

be

.

wanted
to
resk
it
;
so
we
slid
in
there
and
got
three
candles
,
and
tom
laid
five
cents
on
the
table
for
pay
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
give
him
five
cents
to
keep
quiet
,
and
said
we
would
all
go
home
and
meet
next
week
,
and
rob
somebody
and
kill
some
people
.

he
showed
him
how
unregular
it
would
be
,
and
set
down
and
told
him
all
about
our
plans
,
and
how
we
could
alter
them
in
a
minute
any
time
there
was
an
alarm
;
and
not
to
be
the
least
afraid
,
because
we
would
see
he
got
away
,
sure
.

the
king
tripped
and
fell
overboard
,
and
after
that
they
took
a
rest
,
and
had
a
talk
about
all
kinds
of
adventures
they’d
had
in
other
times
along
the

anyway
it

of
looking
at
the

,
like
a

,
one
thing
is
proved—these

he
wagged
his

towards
the

only
about
a
minute
.
|

|
|
|
towards
daylight
we
got
it
all
settled
satisfactory
,
and
concluded
to
drop
crabapples
and
p’simmons

pretty
soon
he
struggled
up
astraddle
and
grabbed
the
bridle
,
a-reeling
this
way
and
that
;
and
the
next
minute
he
sprung
up
and
dropped
the
bridle
and
stood
!

they
see
that
long-legged
undertaker
make
a
sign
to
the
preacher
as
much
as
to
say
,
“don’t

and
make
allowances

|
|
|
|
|
next
minute
i
whirled
in
on
a
kind
of
an
explanation
how
a
valley
was
different
from
a
common
servant
and
had
to
go
to
church
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not
,
and
set
with
the
family
,
on
account
of
its
being
the
law

samson
of

i
have
taken
the
gates
of
gaza
on
my
shoulders
to
carry
them
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
,
and
only
when
i
was
exhausted
,
when
youth
and
health
were
quenched
in
me
forever
,
i
noticed
that
that
burden
was
not
for
my
shoulders
,
and
that
i
had
deceived
myself

then
he
wheeled
her
apart
,
her
legs
going
one
way
,
her
torso
another
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
some
matches
and
proceeded
to
make
a
fire
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
place
over
against
the
wall
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
recognised
freddy
malins'
laugh
.
|
|
|
|
|
asked
one
of
the
young
men
to
move
aside
,
and
,
taking
hold
of
the
decanter
,
filled
out
for
himself
a
goodly
measure
of
whisky
.

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
nodded
familiarly
to
it
and
waved
his
hand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
set
his
unstable
candle
down
on
a
toilet-table
and
asked
at
what
hour
they
were
to
be
called
in
the
morning
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

good-night
and
went
out
.

turned
and
leaned
against
a
chest
of
drawers
with
his
back
to
the
light
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
at
her
intently
,
and
all
at
once
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
,
and
breathed
in
the
moisture
and
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
;
and
he
immediately
looked
round
him
,
anxiously
wondering
whether
any
one
had
seen
them
.

the

at

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
hands
,
examining
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
rang
and
asked
for
tea
to
be
brought
him
,
and
while
he
drank
his
tea
she
remained
standing
at
the
window
with
her
back
to
him
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wandered
about
for
an
hour
and
a
half
,
looking
for
the
side-street
in
which
he
had
left
his
horses
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
passed
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
,
and
now
he
is
wandering
all
over
the
universe
,
still
never
coming
into
conditions
in
which
he
might
disappear
.

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
saw
his
father
,
as
in
mentone
,
in
a
top-hat
with
a
wide
black
band
on
it
,
wearing
mourning
for
some
lady
,
suddenly
seize
him
by
both
hands
,
and
they
fell
headlong
into
a
very
deep
,
dark
pit
.

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
his
horror
that
the
condemned
man
had
also
,
like
him
,
accepted
the
officer’s
invitation
to
inspect
the
arrangement
of
the
harrow
up
close
.

|

|
|
|
|
the
two
men
coming
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
let
her
come
into
the
study
and
she
had
told
him
everything
,
had
confessed
that
she
loved
some
one
else
,
that
that
some
one
else
was
her
real
,
most
lawful
husband
,
and
that
she
thought
it
her

went
down
a

to
the
frozen
path
of
a
small
stream
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
work
on
the
nigger
,
coaxing
him

asking

walked
to
the
left
.

sat
down
on
a
snow-covered
log
to
eat
.
|

bared
the
other
hand
for
the
purpose
of
eating
.
|
|

knew
what
was
wrong
.
|
|
|
|
|
pulled
on
his
mittens
,
settled
his
cap
firmly
about
his
ears
,
and
started
along
the
creek
trail
toward
the
left
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
using
his
teeth
,
and
then
stood
on
his
feet
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
out
a
small
leather
folder
and
said
,
“our

|

very
calm

beat
his
hands
with
all
his
strength
against
his
sides
.

|

|
|
stood
up
to
do
it
.

|
|

and
began
to
unbutton
the
coat
of
his
uniform
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
about
five
minutes
,
picking
tallow-drip
off
of
his
candle
and
thinking
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

how

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

drew
the
whole
pack
along
his
leg
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
noticed
that
the
condemned
man
was
distracting
the
traveler
too
much
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
spread
his
arms
,
apologizing
to
the

clambered
down

after

all
through

he
howled

cussed

all
over

he
polished
off

of
a
general
cuss
all
round
,
including
a
considerable
parcel
of
people
which
he
didn’t

called

begins
to
work
his
jaw
again
,
and
says
how
him
and
his
nieces
would
be
glad
if
a
few
of
the
main
principal
friends
of
the
family
would
take
supper
here
with
them
this
evening
,
and
help
set
up
with
the
ashes
of
the
diseased
;
and
says
if
his
poor
brother
laying
yonder
could
speak
he
knows
who
he
would
name
,
for
they
was
names
that
was
very
dear
to
him
,
and
mentioned
often
in
his
letters
;
and
so
he
will
name
the
same

to
wit
,

opened
up
,
slow

solemn
,
and
begun
to
talk
;
and
straight
off
the
most
outrageous
row
busted
out
in
the
cellar
a
body
ever
heard
;
it
was
only
one
dog
,
but
he
made
a
most
powerful
racket
,
and
he
kept
it
up
right
along
;
the
parson
he
had
to
stand
there
,
over
the
coffin
,
and
wait—you
couldn’t
hear
yourself

as
if
drinking
from

to

outburst

tears

she’d
forgot
her
testament
,
and
left
it
in
the
seat
at
church
between
two
other
books
,
and
would
i
slip
out
quiet
and
go
there
and
fetch
it
to
her
,

not
say
nothing
to
nobody

suddenly
fall
to
musing

retreat
into
herself

i
could
see
from
her
face
that
she
was
not

me

got
to
talking
about
her
husband
,
and
about
her
relations
up
the
river
,
and
her
relations
down
the
river
,
and
about
how
much
better
off
they
used
to
was
,
and
how
they
didn’t
know
but
they’d
made
a
mistake
coming
to
our
town
,
instead
of
letting
well
alone—and
so
on
and
so
on
,
till
i
was
afeard
i
had
made
a
mistake
coming
to
her
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
town
;
but
by
and
by
she
dropped
on
to
pap
and
the
murder
,
and
then
i
was
pretty
willing
to
let
her
clatter
right
along
.

to
try
for
the
next
one
.
|

|
|
|
|
took
off
the
hank
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
,
and
very
pleasant
,
and
says
:
“come

what’s
your

grabbed
up
the
basket
and
slammed
it
across
the
house
and
knocked
the
cat
galley-west
;
and
she
said
cle’r
out
and
let
her
have
some
peace
,
and
if
we
come
bothering
around
her
again
betwixt
that
and
dinner
she’d
skin
us
.

|
|
|
,
just
as
the
chain
was
about
to
start
again
,
she
stood
on
tiptoe
and
whispered
into
his
ear
:
"west
briton
!

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|

suddenly
raising
herself
on
tiptoe
and
resting
her
hands
lightly
on
his
shoulders
,
she
kissed
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slipping
one
arm
swiftly
about
her
body
and
drawing
her
towards
him
,
he
said
softly
:
"gretta
,
dear
,
what
are
you
thinking
about
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
realizing
the
foolishness
of
it
,
he
grasped
his
knife
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
with
both
mittened
hands
,
he
lifted
up
the
pack
of
matches
,
along
with
much
snow
,
to
the
front
of
his
jacket
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
laying
his
hand
pityingly
on
my
shoulder
,
sighed
,
“he
died
of
consumption
at
sing-sing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
order
to
descend
more
quickly
,
instead
of
using
the
ladder
,
he
slid
down
on
one
of
the
poles
and
,
to
make
himself
understandable
through
the
noise
,
strained
his
voice
to
the
limit
as
he
yelled
in
the
traveler’s
ear
,
“do
you
understand
the
process
?

|
|
|
the
night
you’re
ready
,
fetch
the
leg
a
kick
,
down
she
goes
;
slip
off
your
chain
,
and
there
you
are
.

something
in
his
voice
would
strike
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
both
continued
eating
in
silence
,
like
strangers
,
but
after
dinner
they
walked
side
by
side
;
and
there
sprang
up
between
them
the
light
jesting
conversation
of
people
who
are
free
and
satisfied
,
to
whom
it
does
not
matter
where
they
go
or
what
they
talk
about

they
met
every
day
at
twelve
o'clock
on
the
sea-front
,
lunched
and
dined
together
,
went
for
walks
,
admired
the
sea
.

with

honey
,

with
very
nice
cakes
,

in

sat
a
long
time
in
the
dining-room
,
drinking
tea
,
and
ivan
petrovitch
told
some
amusing
story
.

tucked
the
old
man
into
a
beautiful
room
,
which
was
the
spare
room
,
and
in
the
night
some
time
he
got
powerful
thirsty
and
clumb
out
on
to
the
porch-roof
and
slid
down
a
stanchion
and
traded
his
new
coat
for
a
jug
of
forty-rod
,
and
clumb
back
again
and
had
a
good
old
time
;
and
towards
daylight
he
crawled
out
again
,
drunk
as
a
fiddler
,
and
rolled
off
the
porch
and
broke
his
left
arm
in
two
places
,
and
was
most
froze
to
death
when
somebody
found
him
after
sun-up
.

up

there
was
stillness
,
stillness
for
half
a
minute
,
and
at
the

rang
out
.

ekaterina
ivanovna
played
long
and
noisily
on
the
piano
,
and
when
she
finished
she
was
profusely
thanked
and
warmly
praised
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
came
the
fuss
and
worry
of
the
trousseau
,
to
which
the
pesotskys
attached
a
good
deal
of
importance
.
|
|
|

it
seemed
to
volodya
that
the
room
,
nyuta
,
the
sunrise
and
himself—all
melted
together
in
one
sensation
of
acute
,
extraordinary
,
incredible
bliss
,
for
which
one
might
give
up
one's
whole
life
and
face
eternal
torments
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
went
quickly
across
the
white
,
unbroken
surface
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lay
down
in
the
snow
and
began
to
bite
out
the
ice
that
had
formed
between
the
toes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
flattened
its
ears
,
expecting
the
man’s
curse
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
turned
and
ran
along
the
trail
toward
the
camp
it
knew
,
where
there
were
the
other
food
providers
and
fire
providers
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fell
completely
open
.
|
|
|
|
begun
to
itch
on
the
inside
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
most
daylight
and
everybody
went
to
bed
,
and
i
went
to
bed
with
buck
,
and
when
i
waked
up
in
the
morning
,
drat
it
all
,
i
had
forgot
what
my
name
was
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
felt
something
else
projecting
,
and
once
more
pressed
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
everything
was
blurred
and
vanished
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
heard
a
loud
sigh
from
orlov
,
and
his
voice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
noise
and
bustle
in
the
passage
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
go
out
into
the
corridor
again
,
listen
in
a
tremor
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
the
man
chained
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
set
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
tried
to
think
of
something
cheerful
,
but
it
warn’t
no
use
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
cried
;
i
couldn’t
help
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
out
a
line
to
catch
some
fish
for
breakfast
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
thinking
over
how
to
get
at
it
,
and
turned
over
some
considerable
many
ways
in
my
mind
;
and
at
last
fixed
up
a
plan
that
suited
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slipped
down
to
the
ground
and
crawled
in
among
the
trees
,
and
,
sure
enough
,
there
was
tom
sawyer
waiting
for
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
turned
around
and
there
he
was
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
,
with
my
clothes
all
on
;
but
i
couldn’t
a
gone
to
sleep
if
i’d
a
wanted
to
,
i
was
in
such
a
sweat
to
get
through
with
the
business
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fixed
the
piece
of
log
back
into
its
place
,
and
put
two
rocks
under
it
and
one
against
it
to
hold
it
there
,
for
it
was
bent
up
at
that
place
and
didn’t
quite
touch
ground
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
up
the
pig
and
held
him
to
my
breast
with
my
jacket
(so
he
couldn’t
drip)
till
i
got
a
good
piece
below
the
house
and
then
dumped
him
into
the
river
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
carried
the
sack
about
a
hundred
yards
across
the
grass
and
through
the
willows
east
of
the
house
,
to
a
shallow
lake
that
was
five
mile
wide
and
full
of
rushes—and
ducks
too
,
you
might
say
,
in
the
season
.

|
|
|

|
|
tied
up
the
rip
in
the
meal
sack
with
a
string
,
so
it
wouldn’t
leak
no
more
,
and
took
it
and
my
saw
to
the
canoe
again
.

my

the
law
had
bound
me
out
to
a
mean
old
farmer
in
the
country
thirty
mile
back
from
the
river
,
and
he
treated
me
so
bad
i
couldn’t
stand
it
no
longer
;
he
went
away
to
be
gone
a
couple
of
days
,
and
so
i
took
my
chance
and
stole
some
of
his
daughter’s
old
clothes
and
cleared
out
,

i
had
been
three

i
was
nearly
busting

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
raised
a
yell
.
|
|
|
|
was
glad
i
hadn’t
found
the
bed
when
i
wanted
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
struck
up
the
road
,
and
when
i
passed
the
mill
i
see
a
sign
on
it
,
“phelps’s
sawmill
,”
and
when
i
come
to
the
farm-houses
,
two
or
three
hundred
yards
further
along
,
i
kept
my
eyes
peeled
,
but
didn’t
see
nobody
around
,

it
was
good
daylight
now

taking
my
hat
and
cane
and
going
to
the
door
i
tranquilly
turned
and
added—“after
you
have
removed
your
things
from

offices
,
bartleby
,
you
will
of
course
lock
the

receive
one
without

|
|
|
|
|
|
one
last
thing
went
wrong
:
the
body
would
not
come
loose
from
the
needles
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
of
them
got
on
one
side
of
the
coffin
,
and
t’other
on
t’other
side
,
and
they
kneeled
down
and
rested
their
foreheads
on
the
coffin
,
and
let
on
to
pray
all
to
themselves
.

|
|
|
for
an
hour
it
was
deadly
dull
,
and
i
was
fidgety
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
away
out
in
the
woods
i
heard
that
kind
of
a
sound
that
a
ghost
makes
when
it
wants
to
tell
about
something
that’s
on
its
mind
and
can’t
make
itself
understood
,
and
so
can’t
rest
easy
in
its
grave
,
and
has
to
go
about
that
way
every
night
grieving
.

tom
said
he
hadn’t
got
candles
enough
,
and
he
would
slip
in
the
kitchen
and
get
some
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

and
bob
went
to
the
sideboard
where
the
decanter
was
,
and
mixed
a
glass
of
bitters
and
handed
it
to
him
,
and
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
waited
till
tom’s
and
bob’s
was
mixed
,
and
then
they
bowed
and
said
,
“our
duty
to
you
,
sir
,
and
madam
;”
and
they
bowed
the
least
bit
in
the
world
and
said
thank
you
,
and
so
they
drank
,
all
three
,
and
bob
and
tom
poured
a
spoonful
of
water
on
the
sugar
and
the
mite
of
whisky
or
apple
brandy
in
the
bottom
of
their
tumblers
,
and
give
it
to
me
and
buck
,
and
we
drank
to
the
old
people
too
.

slipped
along
down
in

past

up

supper
,
and
the
king

fairly
laughed
their
bones
loose
over
the

up
a
place
close

hide
the

in

amongst

thick
willows

hung
up
our

lantern

was

once
more

went
loafing
around
the

.
|
|
|
|
|
to
the
nigger
cabins
,
and
while
i
got
nat’s
notice
off
,
tom
shoved
a
piece
of
candlestick
into
the
middle
of
a
corn-pone
that
was
in
jim’s
pan
,
and
we
went
along
with
nat
to
see
how
it
would
work
,
and
it
just
worked
noble
;
when
jim
bit
into
it
it
most
mashed
all
his
teeth
out
;
and
there
warn’t
ever
anything

here
comes
the

man
,
with

in

,
for

we
could
hear
them
yelling

barking
at

all
up

down

i

standing
over
him

up

howl

two
,

then
everything
was

they
started

;

they
didn’t

here
comes
the

;
so
i
shoved
for
the
middle
of
the
river
on
a
long
down-stream
slant
;
and
when
i
judged
i
was
out
of
eye-reach
i
laid
on
my
oars
,
and
looked
back
and
see
her
go
and
smell
around
the
wreck
for
miss
hooker’s
remainders
,
because
the
captain
would
know
her
uncle

want
them
;

then
pretty
soon
the
ferryboat
give
it
up

went
for

i
laid
into

kept
whimpering
,

by

by
a
flash
showed
us
a
black
thing
ahead

floating

the
winter
spent
at

to
sit
in

drawing-room
,
to
watch
this
young
,
elegant
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
pure
creature
,
and
to
listen
to
these
noisy

tedious

still
cultured
sounds
,
was

so

they
sat
in

by
the
light
of

lamp
,

did
not
speak
;
it
was
painful
to
him
to
lie
to
her
,

she
wanted
to
ask
him
something

talk
with
tanya
he
went
to
his
room
,
happy
and
triumphant
,
took
up
his
book
or
his
manuscript
with
the
same
passion
with
which
he
had
just
kissed

in

zinaida
fyodorovna
never
applied

she
looked
at
zinaida
fyodorovna
with
a
malignant
joy

hatred
i
could
not
understand
,
and
was
never
tired
of
snorting
with
delight
to
herself
in

in

got
further

further
away

i
couldn’t
make
out
the
words
any
more
;
but
i
could
hear
the
mumble
,

now
and
then
a

here
it
was
all
come

nothing

everything

did
you

you’re

how
their

began

when
i
took
orlov
his
gloves
,
he
was
standing
before
her
with
a
capricious
,
beseeching
face
,
saying
:
"for
god's
sake
,
in
the
name
of
everything
that's
holy
,
don't
talk
of
things
that
everybody
knows

why

b’fo’
‘t
was
so
much
bother

trouble
to
be
a
prisoner
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

did
see
such
a
girl
as
you
.

suppose
it
is
for
the
good
of

the

does
it

they

throw
it

up

me
to
give
up

you
still

for
philosophy
?
|

i
really
must
have
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
hero
.
|

|

|
think
he
has
a
grand
voice

i
know
what
is
the
matter
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
.
|
|
could
.
|
|
|
his
conduct
quite
unusual
,
and
indeed
unjust
,
as
regards
turkey
and
myself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that’s
foolishness
.
|
|
|
it’s
our
duty
to
see
that
they
don’t
get
away
from
here
till
we’ve
looked
into
this
thing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
heard
him
when
he
was
in
his
prime
and
i
think
he
had
then
the
purest
tenor
voice
that
was
ever
put
into
a
man's
throat
.

the
invitation

|

whoop
again
;
it
was
behind
me
yet
,
but
in
a
different
place
;
it
kept
coming
,
and
kept
changing
its
place
,
and
i
kept
answering
,
till
by
and
by
it
was
in
front
of
me
again
,
and
i
knowed
the
current
had
swung
the
canoe’s
head
down-stream
,
and
i
was
all
right
if
that
was
jim
and
not
some
other
raftsman

when
i
got
my
breath
i
asked
her
what
the
paper
was
about
,
and
she
asked
me
if
i
had
read
it
,
and
i
said
no
,
and
she
asked
me
if
i
could
read
writing
,
and
i
told
her
“no
,
only
coarse-hand
,”
and
then
she
said
the
paper
warn’t
anything

a
book-mark
to
keep
her
place
,
and
i
might
go
and
play
now

was
on

goodness

how
it

in

from
which
i

afraid
of
coughing

ready

in

short

every
possibility
open

no
more

to

palm-tree

on

longer
afraid

being
and
seeming
sentimental
,
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
the
fatherly
,

rather
idolatrous
feeling
roused

by
sonya

fumbling
under
the
door
mat
for
the
key
,
which
bartleby
was
to
have
left
there
for
me
,
when
accidentally
my
knee
knocked
against
a
panel
,
producing
a
summoning
sound
,
and
in
response
a
voice
came
to
me
from
within—“not
yet
;
i
am
occupied
.

glad
about
that
,
because
i
wanted
him
and
me
to
be
together
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
way
it
come
out
,
too
,
because
crabapples
ain’t
ever
good
,
and
the
p’simmons
wouldn’t
be
ripe
for
two
or
three
months
yet
.

i
didn’t
drink
whisky
;
but
it
wouldn’t
made
much
difference
anyway
,
because
most
of
the
time
they
couldn’t
a
treed
me
because
i
didn’t
breathe
.

of
that
;
but
the
way
buck
did
take
on
because
he
didn’t
manage
to
kill
harney
that
day
he
shot
at
him—i
hain’t
ever
heard
anything
like
it
.

itching
in
eleven
different
places
now
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
most
ready
to
cry
;
but
all
at
once
i
thought
of
a
way
,
and
so
i
offered
them
miss
watson—they
could
kill
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
powerful
sick
,
and
slunk
to
a
chair
and
set
down
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
getting
sort
of
used
to
the
widow’s
ways
,
too
,
and
they
warn’t
so
raspy
on
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
going
to
follow
around
,
but
i
stooped
down
to
look
at
the
tracks
first
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
catch
some
of
them
,
but
jim
wouldn’t
let
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
rush
by
and
get
away
,
but
a
lot
of
dogs
jumped
out
and
went
to
howling
and
barking
at
me
,
and
i
knowed
better
than
to
move
another
peg
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
in
a
second
and
shinning
down
the
hill
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
judge
thatcher’s
as
quick
as
i
could
get
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
over
welts
.
|
|
|
|
scared
.
|
,
but
a
man
says
:
“he
don’t
mean
nothing
;
he’s
always
a-carryin’
on
like
that
when
he’s
drunk
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pretty
tired
,
and
the
first
thing
i
knowed
i
was
asleep
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hungry
,
but
it
warn’t
going
to
do
for
me
to
start
a
fire
,
because
they
might
see
the
smoke
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
near
certain
i’d
seen
smoke
over
there
,
about
the
head
of
the
island
,
a
day
or
two
before
that
,
so
i
says
to
myself
,
like
as
not
that
nigger’s
hiding
over
there
;
anyway
,
says
i
,
it’s
worth
the
trouble
to
give
the
place
a
hunt
.

away
below
the
ferry
now
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
powerful
lazy
and
comfortable—didn’t
want
to
get
up
and
cook
breakfast
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
glad
to
get
away
from
the
feuds
,
and
so
was
jim
to
get
away
from
the
swamp
.

|

boss
of
it
;
it
all
belonged
to
me
,
so
to
say
,
and
i
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
;
but
mainly
i
wanted
to
put
in
the
time
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ever
so
glad
to
see
jim
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
hungry
i
had
to
stop
two
miles
below
here
at
a
farm
;
so
i
ain’t
hungry
no
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
just
a-biling
with
curiosity
;
and
i
says
to
myself
,
tom
sawyer
wouldn’t
back
out
now
,
and
so
i
won’t
either
;
i’m
a-going
to
see
what’s
going
on
here
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
starting
down
the
ladder
,
and
i
see
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
that
pass
i
didn’t
have
no
reasoning
faculties
no
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
too
scared
.
|
|
small
when
pap
used
to
have
‘em
at
the
palace
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
only
one
that
could
swim
,
so
i
made
a
dash
for
it
,
and
miss
hooker
she
said
if
i
didn’t
strike
help
sooner
,
come
here
and
hunt
up
her
uncle
,
and
he’d
fix
the
thing
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tangled
good
now
.
|
|
|
|
floating
along
,
of
course
,
four
or
five
miles
an
hour
;
but
you
don’t
ever
think
of
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
good
and
tired
,
so
i
laid
down
in
the
canoe
and
said
i
wouldn’t
bother
no
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
glad
when
midday
come
and
no
king
;
we
could
have
a
change
,
anyway—and
maybe
a
chance
for
the
change
on
top
of
it
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sorry
to
hear
jim
say
that
,
it
was
such
a
lowering
of
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stuck
.
|
|
mighty
downhearted
;
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
wouldn’t
ever
go
anear
that
house
again
,
because
i
reckoned
i
was
to
blame
,
somehow
.

about
to
dig
out
from
there
in
a
hurry
,
but
they
was
pretty
close
to
me
then
,
and
sung
out
and
begged
me
to
save
their
lives—said
they
hadn’t
been
doing
nothing
,
and
was
being
chased
for
it—said
there
was
men
and
dogs
a-coming
.

letting
on

up
sin

away
inside

i

the

one
of

say
i
would
do
the
right
thing
and
the
clean
thing
,
and
go
and
write
to
that
nigger’s
owner
and
tell
where
he
was
;
but
deep
down
in
me
i
knowed
it
was
a
lie
,

he
knowed
it

i’d
got

decide

forever
,

two
things
,

i
knowed
it
.

|
|

right

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a-studying
over
my
text
in
acts
seventeen
before
breakfast
,
and
i
reckon
i
put
it
in
there
,
not
noticing
,
meaning
to
put
my
testament
in
,
and
it
must
be
so
,
because
my
testament
ain’t
in
;
but
i’ll
go
and
see
;
and
if
the
testament
is
where
i
had
it
,
i’ll
know
i
didn’t
put
it
in
,
and
that
will
show
that
i
laid
the
testament
down
and
took
up
the
spoon
,

“oh

the
land’s

go
and
look
at
a
place
right
about
the
middle
of
the
island
that
i’d
found
when
i
was
exploring
;
so
we
started
and
soon
got
to
it
,
because
the
island
was
only
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
.

i
didn’t
let

|
|
|

get
aboard
of
her
and
slink
around
a
little
,
and
see
what
there
was
there
.
|
|
|

plans

|
|
|
|
|
my
future
wife
to
have
just
such
a
face
,
such
a
voice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
an
axe
,
but
there
wasn’t
any
,
only
the
one
out
at
the
woodpile
,
and
i
knowed
why
i
was
going
to
leave
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
told
my
husband
i
was
ill
,
and
came
here
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
him
i
had
an
old
slick
counterfeit
quarter
that
warn’t
no
good
because
the
brass
showed
through
the
silver
a
little
,
and
it
wouldn’t
pass
nohow
,
even
if
the
brass
didn’t
show
,
because
it
was
so
slick
it
felt
greasy
,
and
so
that
would
tell
on
it
every
time
.

warn’t
afraid
of
him
telling
the
people
where
i
was
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
were
out
of
sight
,
so
he
come
aboard
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
me
and
my
brother
was
over
on
spanish
island
hunting
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
camped
on
a
piece
of
a
raft
we
found
,
and
about
midnight
he
must
a
kicked
his
gun
in
his
dreams
,
for
it
went
off
and
shot
him
in
the
leg
,
and
we
wanted
him
to
go
over
there
and
fix
it
and
not
say
nothing
about
it
,
nor
let
anybody
know
,
because
we
wanted
to
come
home
this
evening
and
surprise
the
folks
.

herself
she
wouldn’t
set
down

watch

|

|
|
can't
talk
.
|
|
go
to
law
with
her
,
you'll
admit
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stir
a
step
out
of
this
cellar
.
|
|
|

|
get
used

it
.
|

understand
such
anxiety

bear
it
,
i
can't
bear
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lose
much
.
|
|
|
|
almost
died
of
fright
!
|
|
|
|
|
should
have
thought
that
if
she
is
given
anything
for
the
heart
it
ought
to
be
drops
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
you
might
have
arranged
a
separate
flat
for
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
poisoned
myself
then
as
i
meant
to
,
and
there
would
have
been
none
of
this
tedious
farce
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
been
quite
delighted
with
his
application
,
had
be
been
cheerfully
industrious
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
be
very
glad
and
even
happy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
never
go
and
see
a
woman
unless
i
were
sure
beforehand
that
she
would
be
beautiful
and
fascinating
;
and
i
should
never
go
unless
i
were
in
the
mood
.

meet
her
now
!

die
with
the
thought
that
she
is
provided
for
.

hope
we
can
find
a
way
that’s
a

by

they
put

your

people
often
done

when
a

you

if
sometimes
i

the
opposite

it

i

and
you
want
me
to
go
on
living
in
this
town
,
to
go
on
living
this
empty
,
useless
life
,
which
has
become
insufferable
to
me
.

you
to
speak
!
|

help
me
compare
this
sheet
here—take
it
,”
and
i
thrust
it
towards
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
take
it
;
i
want
to
give
it
to
you—the
six
thousand
and
all
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
peace
,
tranquillity
;
i
want
warmth—this
sea
here—to
have
you
near
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
.
|
|
|
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
go
,
but
afterwards
i
thought
better
of
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
we
should
talk
without
stopping
till
morning
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
right
on
the
track
of
a
solution
,
but
it’s
gone
to
grass
,
partly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
of
no
one
but
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
would
go
into
a
nunnery
or
become
a
nurse
,
and
give
up
all
thought
of
happiness
,
but
then
i
remembered
that
you
loved
me
,
and
that
i
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
myself
without
your
knowledge
;
and
everything
in
my
mind
was
in
a
tangle—i
was
in
despair
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
think
.

was
a
goner
,
for
whenever
anybody
was
after
anybody
i
judged
it
was
me—or
maybe
jim
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

that
i

hardly

a
better
opportunity

turkey
would
appreciate
the
favor
,

abate
his
rashness
and
obstreperousness
of
afternoons
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
myself
,
surely
i
must
get
rid
of
a
demented
man
,
who
already
has
in
some
degree
turned
the
tongues
,
if
not
the
heads
of
myself

clerks

it
all
out
,

reckoned
i
would
belong
to
the
widow’s
if
he
wanted
me
,
though
i
couldn’t
make
out
how
he
was
a-going
to
be
any
better
off
then
than
what
he
was
before
,
seeing
i
was
so
ignorant
,
and
so
kind
of
low-down
and
ornery
.

over
,
and
i
reckoned
i
would
walk
off
with
the
gun
and
some
lines
,
and
take
to
the
woods
when
i
run
away
.

you

hocus
me
again
.

|
them
poor
girls
and
them
niggers
would
break
their
hearts
for
grief
;
they
cried
around
each
other
,
and
took
on
so
it
most
made
me
down
sick
to
see
it
.

till
i
wore
my
head
sore
,
but
i
couldn’t
see
no
way
out
of
the
trouble
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

deny
myself
everything

this
is
what
they
provide

my
dinner
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
.
|
him
,
our
excellent
commandant—the
way
he
immediately
pushes
his
stool
aside
and
hurries
out
to
the
balcony—i
see
his
women
,
how
they
stream
after
him
.

the

go
off

the

the

fog
closing
down
,
and
it
made
me
so
sick
and
scared
i
couldn’t
budge
for
most
a
half
a
minute
it
seemed
to
me—and
then
there
warn’t
no
raft
in
sight
;
you
couldn’t
see
twenty
yards
.

the
way
it
was

i
dasn’t

around

i
was
weakening
;
so
i
just
give
up
trying
,
and
up
and
says
:
“he’s
white
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
a
stump
again
,
so
i
played
another
chicken
bone
and
got
another
think
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
spoke
too
sudden

said

much

was
in
a
close
place
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

how
maybe
i
could
get
me
and
jim
rid
of
the
frauds
;
get
them
jailed
here
,
and
then
leave
.

i’d
got
to
invent
a
bar
,
or
forget
the
name
of
the
one
we
got
aground
on—or—now
i
struck
an
idea
,
and
fetched
it
out
:
“it
warn’t
the
grounding—that
didn’t
keep
us
back
but
a
little
.
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
warn’t
a
bit
of
use
to
try
to
go
ahead—i’d
got
to
throw
up
my
hand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wash
my
hands
of
it
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
humbly
apologise
that
as
a
father
,
from
a
sincere
desire
for
your
welfare
,
i
have
disturbed
you
and
your
mentors
.

|

remember
that
when
you
used
to
come
to
us
for
the
summer
holidays
,
or
simply
a
visit
,
it
always
seemed
to
be
fresher
and
brighter
in
the
house
,
as
though
the
covers
had
been
taken
off
the
lustres
and
the
furniture
.

gruzin
,
who
was
a
little
drunk
,
was
wearisomely
long
in
getting
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
long
white
fingers
,
that
looked
like
a
pianist's
;
and
,
indeed
,
there
was
something
of
a
musician
,
of
a
virtuoso
,
about
his
whole
figure
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|
|
it
was
the
beginning
of
march
;
a
thaw
had
set
in
,
and
for
some
days
past
the
cabmen
had
been
driving
on
wheels
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
our
black
gondola
swayed
softly
in
the
same
place
while
the
water
faintly
gurgled
under
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
were
two
expressions
on
her
face
:
one—cold
,
indifferent
,
apathetic
;
the
other—a
look
of
childish
helplessness
given
her
by
the
white
cap
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
spoke
to
him
and
he
stands
like
a
post
and
only
blinks
his
eyes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
meant
to
ask
:
what
will
happen
to
the
garden
when
i
die
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
love
it
perhaps
more
than
myself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
you
,
and
am
used
to
loving
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,"
he
said
.
|
|
|
|
!
|
|
to
sit
in
your
study
in
the
evening
and
let
my
thoughts
carry
me
far
,
far
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
work
from
morning
to
night
:
i
do
all
the
grafting
myself
,
the
pruning
myself
,
the
planting
myself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
do
it
all
myself
:
when
any
one
helps
me
i
am
jealous
and
irritable
till
i
am
rude
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
know
why
,
but
i
went
into
the
drawing-room
to
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
speak
it
in
vanity
,
but
simply
record
the
fact
,
that
i
was
not
unemployed
in
my
profession
by
the
late
john
jacob
astor
;
a
name
which
,
i
admit
,
i
love
to
repeat
,
for
it
hath
a
rounded
and
orbicular
sound
to
it
,
and
rings
like
unto
bullion
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wish
any
reward
but
to
know
i
have
done
the
right
thing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
only
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
keep

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
once
saw
him
angry
.
|
|
|
|
|
racked
my
brains
to
think
why
this
deception
was
necessary
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knew
one
thing—that
i
must
make
haste
to
pack
my
things
and
be
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
want
to
go
along
by
,
but
the
dogs
won’t
let
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
you
to
try—you
needn’t
keep
it
up
if
it
don’t
work
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
repeat
,
if
you
want
to
be
healthy
and
normal
,
go
to
the
common
herd
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
say
it
in
earnest
;
i
begin
to
feel
perplexed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
out
of
my
mind
,
i
had
megalomania
;
but
then
i
was
cheerful
,
confident
,
and
even
happy
;
i
was
interesting
and
original
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
the
woods
and
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
a
long
time
,
but
i
couldn’t
see
no
advantage
about
it—except
for
the
other
people
;
so
at
last
i
reckoned
i
wouldn’t
worry
about
it
any
more
,
but
just
let
it
go
.

|

cooked
a
supper
,
and
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
i
would
stay
there
all
night
when
i
hear
a
plunkety-plunk
,
plunkety-plunk
,
and
says
to
myself
,
horses
coming
;

next
i
hear
people’s
voices

loafed
around

it
was
my
turn
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thinking
out
a
plan
,
but
only
just
to
be
doing
something
;
i
knowed
very
well
where
the
right
plan
was
going
to
come
from
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
lay
on
my
bed
,
but
remembering
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
,
i
got
up
with
an
effort
and
with
a
heavy
,
burning
head
went
to
the
table
again
.

|
|
told
the
widow
about
it
,
and
she
said
the
thing
a
body
could
get
by
praying
for
it
was
“spiritual
gifts
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
away
.
|
|
in
to
see
zinaida
fyodorovna
,
feeling
as
though
i
were
the
father
of
the
child
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
and
says
:
“miss
mary
jane
,
you
can’t
a-bear
to
see
people
in
trouble
,
and
i
can’t—most
always
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
to
my
room
with
a
piece
of
candle
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
our
room
,
and
judged
i
would
take
a
nap
myself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
set
down
on
a
log
at
the
head
of
the
island
,
and
looked
out
on
the
big
river
and
the
black
driftwood
and
away
over
to
the
town
,
three
mile
away
,
where
there
was
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
.

|
|
down
to
the
front
garden
and
clumb
over
the
stile
where
you
go
through
the
high
board
fence
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

along
up
the
bank
with
one
eye
out
for
pap
and
t’other
one
out
for
what
the
rise
might
fetch
along
.

|
|
|

slow
then
,
and
i
warn’t
right
down
certain
whether
i
was
glad
i
started
or
whether
i
warn’t

for

cautious

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up-stream
far
enough
to
make
the
head
of
the
island
,
and
then
started
across
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tearing
after
it
,
listening
sharp
to
hear
it
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
off
in
the
canoe
to
ask
about
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
to
the
river
,
studying
over
this
thing
,
and
pretty
soon
i
noticed
that
my
nigger
was
following
along
behind
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

on
a-whimpering
,
and
says
:
“i
don’t
want
to
blow
on
nobody
;
and
i
ain’t
got
no
time
to
blow
,
nohow

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
straight
out
in
the
country
as
much
as
a
mile
before
i
stopped
;
then
i
doubled
back
through
the
woods
towards
phelps’
.

around
and
clumb
over
the
back
stile
by
the
ash-hopper
,
and
started
for
the
kitchen
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
right
along
,
not
fixing
up
any
particular
plan
,
but
just
trusting
to
providence
to
put
the
right
words
in
my
mouth
when
the
time
come
;
for
i’d
noticed
that
providence
always
did
put
the
right
words
in
my
mouth
if
i
left
it
alone
.

hate
you
with
my

you

soon

took
you
for
an
extraordinary
man

i
loved

you

and
took
it
to
where
the
canoe
was
hid
,
and
shoved
the
vines
and
branches
apart
and
put
it
in
;
then
i
done
the

with

of

it
used

ripped
a
hole
in
the

of
it
with
the

,
for
there
warn’t
no

out
from

if

laid
down

snored
away
;

by
and
by
the
storm
let
up
for
good
and
all
;
and
the
first
cabin-light
that
showed
i
rousted
him
out
,

we
slid
the

into

i
took
the
wadding
;
i
took
the

;
i
took
a

,

my

cent
.

|
|
a
good
gap
and
a
stretch
,
and
was
just
going
to
unhitch
and
start
when
i
heard
a
sound
away
over
the
water
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

out
the
plug
and
shook
out
the
little
dab
of
quicksilver
,
and
set
my
teeth
in
.

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
notice
,
and
done
better
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
off
the
sun-bonnet
,
for
i
didn’t
want
no
blinders
on
then
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
after
it
;
but
when
i
got
to
it
it
warn’t
nothing
but
a
couple
of
sawlogs
made
fast
together
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
one
slow
step
at
a
time
and
there
warn’t
a
sound
,
only
i
thought
i
could
hear
my
heart
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
up
,
and
held
it
in
my
hand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
entered
this
orlov's
service
on
account
of
his
father
,
a
prominent
political
man
,
whom
i
looked
upon
as
a
serious
enemy
of
my
cause
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

reckoned
that
,
living
with
the
son
,
i
should—from
the
conversations
i
should
hear
,
and
from
the
letters
and
papers
i
should
find
on
the
table—learn
every
detail
of
the
father's
plans
and
intentions
.

i
couldn’t
stand
it
more’n
a
minute
longer
,
but
i
set
my
teeth
hard
and
got
ready
to
try
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
scared
now
,
too
;
but
in
a
minute
i
see
i
was
mistaken—that
is
,
after
the
first
jolt
,
as
you
may
say
,
when
my
breath
sort
of
hitched
,
he
being
so
unexpected
;
but
right
away
after
i
see
i
warn’t
scared
of
him
worth
bothring
about
.

would
have
great
times
now
if
i
was
over
at
the
town
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
better
keep
still
.
|
|
|
start
in
on
my
plan
straight
off
without
fooling
around
,
because
i
wanted
to
stop
jim’s
mouth
till
these
fellows
could
get
away
.

he
believed
in
the
a-rabs
and
the
elephants
,
but
as
for
me
i
think
different
.
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|

|
|

|
jim
had
fetched
up
on
a
snag
,
maybe
,
and
it
was
all
up
with
him
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
poor
king
was
in
for
a
gaudy
time
of
it
with
the
audience
,
but
nothing
of
the
sort
;
pretty
soon
he
crawls
out
from
under
the
wigwam
,
and
says
:
“well
,
how’d
the
old
thing
pan
out
this
time
,
duke
?

if
she
knowed
me
she’d
take
a
job
that
was
more
nearer
her
size
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they’d
turn
pale
.
|
|
|
|
|
helped
him
to
dress
,
and
he
let
me
do
it
with
an
air
of
reluctance
without
speaking
or
noticing
my
presence
;
then
with
his
head
wet
with
washing
,
smelling
of
fresh
scent
,
he
used
to
go
into
the
dining-room
to
drink
his
coffee
.

the
indescribable
feeling

,
walking
in
the
tropical
forest

looking
at
the
sunset
in
the
bay
of
bengal
,
one
is
thrilled

ecstasy

at

homesick

music

,
with
the
curiosity
of
a

i
looked
into

lashes

up
my
mind
i
would
fix
up
some
way
to
leave
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wouldn’t
ever
take
a-holt
of
a
snake-skin
again
with
my
hands
,
now
that
i
see
what
had
come
of
it

fast
to
a
willow
;
then
i
took
a
bite
to
eat
,
and
by
and
by
laid
down
in
the
canoe
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
lay
out
a
plan
.

|
|
|

and
laid
down
under
jim’s
nose
on
the
raft
,
and
began
to
gap
,
and
stretch
my
fists
out
against
jim
,
and
says
:
“hello
,
jim
,
have
i
been
asleep
?

mile
and
a
half
,
and
then
struck
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
,
because
pretty
soon
i
would
be
passing
the
ferry
landing
,
and
people
might
see
me
and
hail
me
.

out

the

about
a
mile
below

been
fooling
along
ever

people

they

|
|

this
very
gently
,
however
,
because
,
though
the
civilest
,
nay
,
the
blandest

most
reverential
of
men
in
the
morning
,
yet
in

afternoon
he

upon

had
a
bad
cough
at
that
time
,
and
sometimes
at
night
i
prevented
her
from
sleeping
,
as
our
rooms
were
only
divided
by
a
wooden
partition

every

she

at
her
feet
,
to
entreat
her
not
to
weep
in
solitude
,
but
to
share
her
grief
with
me
,
and
the
monotonous
murmur
of
the
sea
already
sounded
a
gloomy
prophecy
in
my
ears

i
foresaw
fresh

fresh

in

of

i’d
of
liked
to
run
up

town

see
them
,

i
dasn’t
,
because
the
nigger
might
get
away
,

then
i’d
be

never
a

to
pekarsky's

before—that
is
,
i
had
stood
in
the
hall
and
looked
into
the
drawing-room
,
and
,
after
the
damp
,
gloomy
street
,
it
always
struck
me
by
the
brilliance
of
its
picture-frames
,
its
bronzes

school
most
all
the
time
and
could
spell
and
read
and
write
just
a
little
,
and
could
say
the
multiplication
table
up
to
six
times
seven
is
thirty-five
,
and
i
don’t
reckon
i
could
ever
get
any

|
|
|

|
|
|
only
to
use
a
little
physical
violence
,
then
snatch
his
watch
to
disguise
the
object
of
the
crime
,
and
to
get
off
by
the
back
way
,
and
i
should
have
gained
infinitely
more
than
i
could
have
imagined
possible
when

up
the

to

for
myself
.
|

|
about
her
seriously
.
|
|

take
to
my
bed
and
stay
there
for
a
fortnight
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
do
something
with
my

;
so
i
took
up
a

off
of

went

it
.

claw
away
from
the
bank
pretty
lively
four
or
five
times
,
to
keep
from
knocking
the
islands
out
of
the
river
;
and
so
i
judged
the
raft
must
be
butting
into
the
bank
every
now
and
then
,
or
else
it
would
get
further
ahead
and
clear
out
of
hearing—it
was
floating
a
little
faster
than
what
i
was

for

some
way
,
so
i
says
:
“my

in

,
where
i

they

on
to
get
choked
with
a

bone
,

skip
around
a
bit
,
and
jump
up
and
crack
my
heels
a
few
times—i
couldn’t
help
it
;
but
about
the
third
crack
i
noticed
a
sound
that
i
knowed
mighty
well
,
and
held
my
breath
and
listened
and
waited
;
and
sure
enough
,
when
the
next
flash
busted
out
over
the
water
,
here
they
come
!

scarcely
crossed
the
threshold
when
from
the
room
where
she
was
lying
i
heard
a
low
,
plaintive
moan
,
and
,
as
though
it
had
been
wafted
me
by
the
wind
from
russia
,
i
thought
of
orlov
,
his
irony
,
polya
,
the
neva
,
the
drifting
snow
,
then
the
cab
without
an
apron
,
the
prediction
i
had
read
in
the
cold
morning
sky
,
and
the
despairing
cry
"nina

imagined
you
of
such
a
gentlemanly
organization

that
in

a

i

piece
and
some
other
money
,
but
i
reckoned
i
better
save
it
,
because
there
ain’t
no
telling
how
soon
you
are
going
to
need
it
,
away
from

mind
on
the
children
all
the
time
;
i
wanted
to
get
them
out
to
one
side
and
pump
them
a
little
,
and
find
out
who
i
was

stopped
cussing

because
the
widow
didn’t
like
it
;

now
i
took
to
it
again

hadn’t
no

many
a

wore
the

a
good

crawling
out

dragging
out
so
many
things
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

heard
about

not
all

|
|
|
|

it

the
middle
watch
,
you
know
,
but
i
was
pretty
sleepy
by
that
time
,
so
jim
he
said
he
would
stand
the
first
half
of
it
for
me

he

all
to

i
fairly
flew—leastways
,
i
had
it
all
to
myself
except
the
solid
dark
,

the
now-and-then
glares
,

the
buzzing
of
the

the
thrashing
of
the
wind
,
and
the
splitting

it
out
of
there
before
they
was
half-way
down
stairs
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

,
because
i
stole
it
from
them
;
and
i
stole
it
to
give
to
you
;
and
i
know
where
i
hid
it
,

i’m

it
ain’t
there
no

just
one
little
glimpse

the
old
gentleman
when
he
come
in
;

the

hid
him
.

everything
i
needed
,
and
the
boy
was
doing
as
well
there
as
he
would
a
done
at
home—better
,
maybe
,
because
it
was
so
quiet
;
but
there
i
was
,
with
both
of
‘m
on
my
hands
,
and
there
i
had
to
stick
till
about
dawn
this
morning
;
then
some
men
in
a
skiff
come
by
,
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
the
nigger
was
setting
by
the
pallet
with
his
head
propped
on
his
knees
sound
asleep
;
so
i
motioned
them
in
quiet
,
and
they
slipped
up
on
him
and
grabbed
him
and
tied
him
before
he
knowed
what
he
was
about
,
and
we
never
had
no
trouble
.

have
come
just
for
a
minute

|

|
|
|
|
|

ashamed
and
i
ran
back
to
the
house
.

for
the

put
the

i
was
alone
again

there
was
no

us

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
strangely
goaded
on
to
encounter
him
in
new
opposition

to
elicit
some
angry
spark
from
him
answerable

my

.

|
my
most
precious
papers
perfectly
safe
in
his
hands
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
his
hand
,
when
a

shiver
ran
up

down

to

lonesome

dead

|
|
|
|
ornery
and
low
down
and
mean

i

a
little
bit
heavy-hearted
about
the
gang
,

not
much
,

i

anybody

very
good
;
i

i

realised
that
at
breakfast
,
when
he
began
assuring
her
that
for
the
sake
of
her
peace
of
mind
it

essential

give
up

,
expecting
that

musical
soul
would
not
endure
this
laughter
,

i
was
mistaken

it
come
creeping
down
,
and
when
it
was
most
abreast

i
heard
a
man
say
,
“stern

their
faces
to
see
if
anything

i

tell

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
look
upon
love
primarily
as
a
necessity
of
my
physical
nature
,
degrading
and
antagonistic
to
my
spirit
;
it
must
either
be
satisfied
with
discretion
or
renounced
altogether
,
otherwise
it
will
bring
into
one's
life
elements
as
unclean
as
itself

give
her
a
talking
to
,
but
she
would
raise
a
wail
in
answer
,
and
declare
in
all
sincerity
that
i

ruined
her

that

it
was
the

if
he
had
had
to
deceive
his
minister
or
any
other
influential
person
he
would
have
put
a
great
deal
of
skill
and
energy
into
doing
so
;
but
to
deceive
a
woman
,
the
first
idea
that
occurred
to
him
was
evidently
good
enough

the
first
house
would
keep
mum
and
let
the
rest
of
the
town
get
roped
in
;
and
i
knew
they’d
lay
for
us
the
third
night
,
and
consider
it

their
turn
now
.

left
him
deeply
engrossed
,

the
book
did
not
drop
out

it

done
in
the
evening

my

came
to
you
,

am
proud
of
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

particularly
remember
one
dress
which
cost
four
hundred
roubles

|
|
|

|

|
|
|
|
opened
my
eyes
and
i
saw
that
we
had
come
to
a
standstill
in
sergievsky
street
,
near
a
big
house
where
pekarsky
lived
.

mouth
to
begin
;
but
she
grabbed
me
and
hustled
me
in
behind
the
bed
,
and
says
:
“here
he
comes
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|

it
,
and
saw
it
was
a
savings’
bank
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
with
trembling
hands
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
must
confess
i
had
by
no
means
a
poor
opinion
of
his
intelligence
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
own
it
was
a
dreadful
time
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
have
stumbled
against
the
furniture
in
the
dark
and
made
a
noise
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lay
it
by
in
my
mind
,
and
think
it
over
some
time
or
other
,
it’s
so
kind
of
strange
and
unregular
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

go
up
the
road

waylay
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hoped
he
would
contrive
some
deception
,
would
make
arrangements
,
for
instance
,
that
a
telegram
should
be
sent
to
her
from
some
station
.

they
was
going
to
say
he
could
have
one
or
two
of
the
chains
took
off
,
because
they
was
rotten
heavy
,
or
could
have
meat
and
greens
with
his
bread
and
water
;
but
they
didn’t
think
of
it
,
and
i
reckoned
it
warn’t
best
for
me
to
mix
in
,
but
i
judged
i’d
get
the
doctor’s
yarn
to
aunt
sally
somehow
or
other
as
soon
as
i’d
got
through
the
breakers
that
was
laying
just
ahead
of
me—explanations
,
i
mean
,
of
how
i
forgot
to
mention
about
sid
being
shot
when
i
was
telling
how
him
and
me
put
in
that
dratted
night
paddling
around
hunting
the
runaway
nigger
.

detest
both
classes
,
but
if
i
had
honestly
to
choose
between
the
two
,
i
should
without
hesitation
,
prefer
the
upper
class
,
and
there
would
be
no
falsity
or
affectation
about
it
,
since
all
my
tastes
are
in
that
direction
.

remembered
that
she
had
no
father

mother
,
no
relations
,
and
here
she
was
living
between
a
man
who
hated
her

polya

who
robbed
her—and
how
desolate
her
life
seemed
to
me

bartleby
never
left
the
office
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
never
spoke
but
to
answer
;
that
though
at
intervals
he
had
considerable
time
to
himself
,
yet
i
had
never
seen
him
reading—no
,
not
even
a
newspaper
;
that
for
long
periods
he
would
stand
looking
out
,
at
his
pale
window
behind
the
screen
,
upon
the
dead
brick
wall
;
i
was
quite
sure
he
never
visited
any
refectory
or
eating
house
;
while
his
pale
face
clearly
indicated
that
he
never
drank
beer
like
turkey
,
or
tea
and
coffee
even
,
like
other
men
;
that
he
never
went
any
where
in
particular
that
i
could
learn
;
never
went
out
for
a
walk
,
unless
indeed
that
was
the
case
at
present
;
that
he
had
declined
telling
who
he
was
,
or
whence
he
came
,
or
whether
he
had
any
relatives
in
the
world
;
that
though
so
thin
and
pale
,
he
never
complained
of
ill
health
.

how

in

any

she
was
with

had
gone
off
to
monte

for
some
reason
in

from
me
.
|

|

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

the
bright
silks
and
sparkling
faces
i
had
seen
that
day
,
in
gala
trim
,
swan-like
sailing
down
the
mississippi
of
broadway
;
and
i
contrasted
them
with
the
pallid
copyist
,
and
thought
to
myself
,
ah
,
happiness
courts
the
light
,
so
we
deem
the
world
is
gay
;
but
misery
hides
aloof
,
so
we
deem
that
misery
there
is
none
.

tragedy
of
the
unfortunate
adams
and
the
still
more
unfortunate
colt
in
the
solitary
office
of
the
latter
;
and
how
poor
colt
,
being
dreadfully
incensed
by
adams
,
and
imprudently
permitting
himself
to
get
wildly
excited
,
was
at
unawares
hurried
into
his
fatal
act—an
act
which
certainly
no
man
could
possibly
deplore
more
than
the
actor
himself
.

him
:
it
was
orlov's
father
,
the
distinguished
statesman
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
answered
that
georgy
ivanitch
was
not
at
home
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stood
behind
him
,
gazed
at
his
bald
head
and
at
the
hollow
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
,
and
it
was
clear
as
daylight
to
me
that
this
weak
old
man
was
now
in
my
power
.

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
for
a
little
time
in
the
dining-room
and
then
walked
by
her
again
,
and
she
looked
at
me
intently
and
with
perplexity
,
even
with
alarm
.

long
time
by
the
tomb
of
canova
,
and
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
the
melancholy
lion
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
looked
at
her
,
and
waited
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
a
little
while
,
then
went
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gazing
at
him
awhile
,
as
he
went
on
with
his
own
writing
,
and
then
reseated
myself
at
my
desk
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
listening
for
a
moment
.
|
|
|
|
|
in
the
entry
watching
him
a
moment
,
while
something
from
within
me
upbraided
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a-looking
at
him
;
he
set
there
a-looking
at
me
,
with
his
chair
tilted
back
a
little
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
on
the
bank
and
looked
out
over
the
river
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
by
the
duke
at
the
door
,
and
i
see
that
every
man
that
went
in
had
his
pockets
bulging
,
or
something
muffled
up
under
his
coat—and
i
see
it
warn’t
no
perfumery
,
neither
,
not
by
a
long
sight
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
still
had
time
.
|
|
|
use
the
diagrams
of
the
previous
commandant
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
urged
myself
on
and
clenched
my
fists
,
trying
to
wring
out
of
my
soul
some
trace
of
my
former
hatred
;
i
recalled
what
a
passionate
,
implacable
,
obstinate
hate
i
had
felt
for
him
only
a
little
while
before
.

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bit
my
lips
from
indignation
and
annoyance
,
and
already
hated
zinaida
fyodorovna
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
began
to
feel
as
though
we
had
been
driving
for
a
long
time
,
that
for
ages
we
had
been
suffering
,
and
that
for
ages
i
had
been
listening
to
zinaida
fyodorovna's
shuddering
breath
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
reason
with
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
change
my
dress
,
my
face
,
my
name
,
my
thoughts

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knock
timidly
and
guiltily
at
her
door
and
get
no
answer
;
i
would
knock
again—still
silence
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stand
near
the
door
and
listen
;
then
the
chambermaid
would
pass
and
say
coldly
,
"madame
est
partie

like
to
add
to
this
report
only
the
fact
that
this
particular
execution
was
attended
by
the
great
explorer
whose
visit
confers
such
extraordinary
honour
on
our
colony
,
as
you
all

thou

for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
,
the
oppressor’s
wrong
,
the
proud
man’s
contumely
,
the
law’s
delay

the
quietus

his

take

we’d
a
timed
her

had
the
handling
of
louis
xvi
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
was
a
moat
to
this
cabin
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
bottom
of
this
fortress
was
solid
rock
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
down
at
the
familiar
gondolas
,
which
glide
with
feminine
grace
smoothly
and
majestically
as
though
they
were
alive
,
and
felt
all
the
luxury
of
this
original
,
fascinating
civilisation
.

|
|
|
|
round
anxiously
,
peeped
behind
his
screen
;
but
it
was
very
plain
that
he
was
gone
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
over
my
shoulder
every
now

i
didn’t
see
nobody
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
away
down-stream
,
and
seen
a
black
speck
on
the
water
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
all
around
;
he
warn’t
anywhere

|
|
|
loved
to
sit
in
the
sun
,
and
to
listen
to
the
gondoliers
without
understanding
them
,
and
for
hours
together
to
gaze
at
the
little
house
where
,
they
said
,
desdemona
lived—a
naïve
,
mournful
little
house
with
a
demure
expression
,
as
light
as
lace
,
so
light
that
it
looked
as
though
one
could
lift
it
from
its
place
with
one
hand
.

i
went
on

feeling
i
was
coarse
,
that
i

not
the
tact
,
the
delicacy
which
are
so
essential
when
you

with

soul

closed

went
into

there
i
looked
at
overdressed

heavily
perfumed
women

every
one
of

glanced
at
me

run
to
my
room
and
fall
on
my
bed
,
and
think
and
think
,
and
can
come
to
no
conclusion
;
and
all
that
is
clear
to
me
is
that
i
want
to
live
,
and
that
the
plainer
and
the
colder
and
the
harder
her
face
grows
,
the
nearer
she
is
to
me
,
and
the
more
intensely
and
painfully
i
feel
our
kinship
.

the
canoe
into
a
deep
dent
in
the
bank
that
i
knowed
about
;
i
had
to
part
the
willow
branches
to
get
in
;
and
when
i
made
fast
nobody
could
a
seen
the
canoe
from
the
outside
.

along
the
bank
a
piece
and
got
aboard
,
and
jim
he
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
,
he
was
so
glad
to
see
me
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
in
the
parlor
and
took
a
swift
look
around
,
and
the
only
place
i
see
to
hide
the
bag
was
in
the
coffin
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
across
him
in
the
woods
about
an
hour
or
two
ago
,
and
he
said
if
i
hollered
he’d
cut
my
livers
out—and
told
me
to
lay
down
and
stay
where
i
was
;
and
i
done
it
.

may
seem
to
you
indelicate
,
cruel
,
but
i
don't
care
:
you
love
me
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
dressed
somehow
,
and
almost
fainting
with
terror
ran
to
zinaida
fyodorovna
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fed
her
with
my
own
hands
,
gave
her
her
bath
,
put
her
to
bed
,
never
took
my
eyes
off
her
for
nights
together
,
and
screamed
when
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
nurse
was
just
going
to
drop
her
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thanked
him
and
went
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
seldom
lose
my
temper
;
much
more
seldom
indulge
in
dangerous
indignation
at
wrongs
and
outrages
;
but
i
must
be
permitted
to
be
rash
here
and
declare
,
that
i
consider
the
sudden
and
violent
abrogation
of
the
office
of
master
of
chancery
,
by
the
new
constitution
,
as
a
——
premature
act
;
inasmuch
as
i
had
counted
upon
a
life-lease
of
the
profits
,
whereas
i
only
received
those
of
a
few
short
years
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
verily
believe
that
buttoning
himself
up
in
so
downy
and
blanket-like
a
coat
had
a
pernicious
effect
upon
him
;
upon
the
same
principle
that
too
much
oats
are
bad
for
horses
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
came
within
an
ace
of
dismissing
him
then
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
resolved
to
assign
bartleby
a
corner
by
the
folding-doors
,
but
on
my
side
of
them
,
so
as
to
have
this
quiet
man
within
easy
call
,
in
case
any
trifling
thing
was
to
be
done
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
argue
the
matter
over
with
him
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gather
all
my
faculties
together
,
and
for
ever
rid
me
of
this
intolerable
incubus
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
placed
his
desk
close
up
to
a
small
side-window
in
that
part
of
the
room
,
a
window
which
originally
had
afforded
a
lateral
view
of
certain
grimy
back-yards
and
bricks
,
but
which
,
owing
to
subsequent
erections
,
commanded
at
present
no
view
at
all
,
though
it
gave
some
light
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
repeated
my
request
in
the
clearest
tone
i
could
assume
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
concluded
to
forget
the
matter
for
the
present
,
reserving
it
for
my
future
leisure
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pondered
a
moment
in
sore
perplexity
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
determined
again
to
postpone
the
consideration
of
this
dilemma
to
my
future
leisure
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
observed
that
he
never
went
to
dinner
;
indeed
that
he
never
went
any
where
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
burned
to
be
rebelled
against
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
something
in
condolence
with
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
jim
might
wake
up
and
come
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
why
couldn’t
we
see
them
,
then
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
right
;
then
the
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
go
for
the
magicians
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
paddle
ashore
the
first
time
a
light
showed
,
and
tell
them
pap
was
behind
,
coming
along
with
a
trading-scow
,
and
was
a
green
hand
at
the
business
,
and
wanted
to
know
how
far
it
was
to
cairo
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
wouldn’t
,
and
i’ll
stick
to
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
reckoned
they
killed
him
,
too
;
but
jim
didn’t
want
to
talk
about
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
would
slip
over
the
river
and
find
out
what
was
going
on
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
believed
my
uncle
abner
moore
would
take
care
of
me
,
and
so
that
was
why
i
struck
out
for
this
town
of
goshen
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
know
;
i
hadn’t
heard
about
it
before
,
no
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
.
|
|
|
it
looked
to
me
like
all
the
signs
was
about
bad
luck
,
and
so
i
asked
him
if
there
warn’t
any
good-luck
signs
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
likely
we
wouldn’t
,
because
i
had
heard
say
there
warn’t
but
about
a
dozen
houses
there
,
and
if
they
didn’t
happen
to
have
them
lit
up
,
how
was
we
going
to
know
we
was
passing
a
town
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
no
,
but
i
see
them
sneaking
out
of
the
room
and
hustling
away
,
and
i
never
thought
nothing
,
only
i
reckoned
they
was
afraid
they
had
waked
up
my
master
and
was
trying
to
get
away
before
he
made
trouble
with
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hinted
that
of
course
he
did
wisely
in
abstaining
from
writing
for
a
while
;
and
urged
him
to
embrace
that
opportunity
of
taking
wholesome
exercise
in
the
open
air
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
speak
less
than
truth
when
i
say
that
,
on
his
own
account
,
he
occasioned
me
uneasiness
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
warned
him
to
take
measures
,
in
the
interval
,
for
procuring
some
other
abode
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
offered
to
assist
him
in
this
endeavor
,
if
he
himself
would
but
take
the
first
step
towards
a
removal
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
passed
on
,
very
thankful
that
the
uproar
of
the
street
screened
my
momentary
absent-mindedness
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
line
around
one
of
them
right
on
the
edge
of
the
cut
bank
,
but
there
was
a
stiff
current
,
and
the
raft
come
booming
down
so
lively
she
tore
it
out
by
the
roots
and
away
she
went
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
along
,
and
the
parlor
door
was
open
;
but
i
see
there
warn’t
nobody
in
there
but
the
remainders
of
peter
;
so
i
shoved
on
by
;
but
the
front
door
was
locked
,
and
the
key
wasn’t
there
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tried
the
knob
.
|
|
|
to
fancy
that
in
the
course
of
the
morning
,
at
such
time
as
might
prove
agreeable
to
him
,
bartleby
,
of
his
own
free
accord
,
would
emerge
from
his
hermitage
,
and
take
up
some
decided
line
of
march
in
the
direction
of
the
door
.
|

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
make
out
to
myself
that
i
warn’t
to
blame
,
because
i
didn’t
run
jim
off
from
his
rightful
owner
;
but
it
warn’t
no
use
,
conscience
up
and
says
,
every
time
,
“but
you
knowed
he
was
running
for
his
freedom
,
and
you
could
a
paddled
ashore
and
told
somebody
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
but
the
words
wouldn’t
come
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
.
|
|
for
the
hooks
three
or
four
times
,
but
somehow
i
couldn’t
make
it
work
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
second
or
two
to
brace
up
and
out
with
it
,
but
i
warn’t
man
enough—hadn’t
the
spunk
of
a
rabbit
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
now
said
to
myself
,
buttoning
up
my
coat
to
the
last
button
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
strove
to
be
entirely
care-free
and
quiescent
;
and
my
conscience
justified
me
in
the
attempt
;
though
indeed
it
was
not
so
successful
as
i
could
have
wished
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
then
assured
the
functionary
that
bartleby
was
a
perfectly
honest
man
,
and
greatly
to
be
compassionated
,
however
unaccountably
eccentric
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
begged
to
have
an
interview
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
narrated
all
i
knew
,
and
closed
by
suggesting
the
idea
of
letting
him
remain
in
as
indulgent
confinement
as
possible
till
something
less
harsh
might
be
done—though
indeed
i
hardly
knew
what
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can’t
help
pity
’em—can’t
help
it
,
sir
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
;
and
here
you’re
a-swelling
yourself
up
like
this
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
imitate
him
,
and
so
i
ain’t
a-going
to
try
to
;
but
he
really
done
it
pretty
good
.

get
it
out
of
my
memory
,
the
sight
of
them
poor
miserable
girls
and
niggers
hanging
around
each
other’s
necks
and
crying
;
and
i
reckon
i
couldn’t
a
stood
it
all
,
but
would
a
had
to
bust
out
and
tell
on
our
gang
if
i
hadn’t
knowed
the
sale
warn’t
no
account
and
the
niggers
would
be
back
home
in
a
week
or
two
.

give
the
old
gent’s
words
,
nor
i
can’t
imitate
him
;
but
he
turned
around
to
the
crowd
,
and
says
,
about
like
this
:
“this
is
a
surprise
to
me
which
i
wasn’t
looking
for
;
and
i’ll
acknowledge
,
candid
and
frank
,
i
ain’t
very
well
fixed
to
meet
it
and
answer
it
;
for
my
brother
and
me
has
had
misfortunes
;
he’s
broke
his
arm
,
and
our
baggage
got
put
off
at
a
town
above
here
last
night
in
the
night
by
a
mistake
.

stan’
it
!
|
|
|
|
paused
;
then
went
close
up
to
him
;
stooped
over
,
and
saw
that
his
dim
eyes
were
open
;
otherwise
he
seemed
profoundly
sleeping
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

also
worked
with
him
on
the
very
first
tests
and
took
part
in
all
the
work
right
up
to
its
completion
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wrote
up
his
statement
and
right
after
that
the
sentence
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
don’t
know
of
a
single
one
,
and
i
have
had
a
lot
of
experience
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
how
i’ll
bear
the
tension
up
to
then
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
;
there
may
be
bullier
circuses
than
what
that
one
was
,
but
i
never
struck
them
yet
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
what
in
the
world
to
make
of
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mind
;
but
i
say
it’s
a
fool
way
,
anyhow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
take
no
stock
in
mathematics
,
anyway
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
want
it
at
all—nor
the
six
thousand
,
nuther
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
no
better
book
than
what
your
face
is
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
you
to
see
them
,
nor
your
sisters
,
nor
nobody
in
this
town
;
if
a
neighbor
was
to
ask
how
is
your
uncles
this
morning
your
face
would
tell
something
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
hear
no
more
out
of
you
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
nothing
in
the
way
of
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hear
the
dogs
and
horses
yet
;
you’ve
got
time
to
crowd
through
the
brush
and
get
up
the
crick
a
little
ways
;
then
you
take
to
the
water
and
wade
down
to
me
and
get
in—that’ll
throw
the
dogs
off
the
scent
.

blame
you
,
gentlemen—far
from
it
;
i
don’t
blame
anybody
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
say
that
ourn
is
lambs
,
because
they
ain’t
,
when
you
come
right
down
to
the
cold
facts
;
but
they
ain’t
nothing
to
that
old
ram
,
anyway
.

k’yer
noth’n
‘bout
that—it’s
the
count
i’m
thinkin’
about
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wish
to
be
mixed
up
in
no
such
business
as
that

i

to
myself
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
remember
it
.
|
|
|
deny
it
,
i
was
most
putrified
with
astonishment
when
you
give
me
that
smack
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
usually
kneel
down
at
this
point
and
observe
the
phenomenon
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
admit
i
made
almost
extravagant
use
of
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mean
earlier
,
not
now
,
as
the
new
commandant
claims
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
delivered
the
news
that
everything
was
ready
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
understood
right
away
what
he
intended
with
his
invitation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
find
your
conviction
genuinely
moving
,
even
if
it
cannot
deter
me
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
demand
aladin
!
|
|
|
got
into
my
old
rags
and
my
sugar-hogshead
again
,
and
was
free
and
satisfied
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
down-hearted
and
scared
i
did
wish
i
had
some
company
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
full
of
it
i
didn’t
notice
how
long
i
was
staying
till
the
old
man
hollered
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
asleep
or
drownded
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
and
turned
around
in
my
tracks
three
times
and
crossed
my
breast
every
time
;
and
then
i
tied
up
a
little
lock
of
my
hair
with
a
thread
to
keep
witches
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tried
to
untie
her
,
but
i
was
so
excited
my
hands
shook
so
i
couldn’t
hardly
do
anything
with
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
an
old
tin
lamp
and
an
iron
ring
,
and
went
out
in
the
woods
and
rubbed
and
rubbed
till
i
sweat
like
an
injun
,
calculating
to
build
a
palace
and
sell
it
;
but
it
warn’t
no
use
,
none
of
the
genies
come
.

under
the
table
and
raised
the
blanket
,
and
went
to
work
to
saw
a
section
of
the
big
bottom
log
out—big
enough
to
let
me
through
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
rid
of
the
signs
of
my
work
,
and
dropped
the
blanket
and
hid
my
saw
,
and
pretty
soon
pap
come
in
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
out
amongst
the
driftwood
,
and
then
laid
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
let
her
float
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
good
place
amongst
the
leaves
,
and
set
there
on
a
log
,
munching
the
bread
and
watching
the
ferry-boat
,
and
very
well
satisfied
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
my
traps
out
of
the
canoe
and
made
me
a
nice
camp
in
the
thick
woods
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
everything
into
the
canoe
as
quick
as
i
could
,
and
then
went
creeping
through
the
woods
to
see
what
i
could
find
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
thing
,
and
the
first
rat
that
showed
his
nose
i
let
drive
,
and
if
he’d
a
stayed
where
he
was
he’d
a
been
a
tolerable
sick
rat
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
be
moving
along
.
|
|
|
|
steal
that
money
,
somehow
;
and
i
got
to
steal
it
some
way
that
they
won’t
suspicion
that
i
done
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tell
the
truth
,
and
you
want
to
brace
up
,
miss
mary
,
because
it’s
a
bad
kind
,
and
going
to
be
hard
to
take
,
but
there
ain’t
no
help
for
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
turn
out
and
find
my
nigger
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
some
of
their
jabber
out
of
a
book
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
there
all
out
of
breath
but
loaded
up
with
joy
,
and
sung
out
:
“set
her
loose
,
jim
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
couldn’t
stood
it
much
longer
.
|
|
|
|
|
make
it
out
.
|
|
|
anything
out
of
that
,
so
i
put
the
paper
in
the
book
again
,
and
when
i
got
home
and
upstairs
there
was
miss
sophia
in
her
door
waiting
for
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
get
up
the
chimbly
;
it
was
too
narrow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that
out
of
my
conscience
,
no
how
nor
no
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
my
breath
for
most
a
minute
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
him
to
let
me
stay
and
wait
for
sid
;
and
he
said
there
warn’t
no
use
in
it
,
and
i
must
come
along
,
and
let
aunt
sally
see
we
was
all
right
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tell
how
many
was
in
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
nothing
about
voices
in
a
fog
,
for
nothing
don’t
look
natural
nor
sound
natural
in
a
fog
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
somehow
,
for
thinking
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
look
up
yet
.
|
|
|
|
see
them
,
but
i
could
tell
where
they
was
by
the
whisky
they’d
been
having
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
but
a
little
ways
,
but
i
went
poking
along
over
rough
ground
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
,
and
then
i
run
across
a
big
old-fashioned
double
log-house
before
i
noticed
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
answer
that
.
|
|
|
understand
it
no
way
at
all
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hardly
get
my
words
out
,
i
was
so
anxious
;
but
i
told
tom
as
quick
as
i
could
we
must
jump
for
it
now
,
and
not
a
minute
to
lose—the
house
full
of
men
,
yonder
,
with
guns
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
asked
her
if
she
reckoned
tom
sawyer
would
go
there
,
and
she
said
not
by
a
considerable
sight
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
let
me
think
a
minute
;
and
she
set
there
,
very
impatient
and
excited
and
handsome
,
but
looking
kind
of
happy
and
eased-up
,
like
a
person
that’s
had
a
tooth
pulled
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
him
what
was
become
of
young
harney
and
miss
sophia
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
need
anybody
to
tell
me
that
that
was
an
awful
bad
sign
and
would
fetch
me
some
bad
luck
,
so
i
was
scared
and
most
shook
the

|
|

|
know
how
i
was
going
to
set
still
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
her
face
;
she
was
a
stranger
,
for
you
couldn’t
start
a
face
in
that
town
that
i
didn’t
know
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
whether
the
money
was
in
there
or
not
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nothing
to
do
;
and
if
i
had
i
couldn’t
a
done
it
,
because
that
nigger
busted
in
and
says
:
“why
,
de
gracious
sakes
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
want
him
to
try
.
|
|
|
|
to
go
to
school
much
before
,
but
i
reckoned
i’d
go
now
to
spite
pap
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sleep
,
of
course
;
but
i
was
so
sleepy
i
couldn’t
help
it
;
so
i
thought
i
would
take
jest
one
little
cat-nap
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
back
no
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
no
trouble
with
their
kind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
believe
we
could
lick
such
a
crowd
of
spaniards
and
a-rabs
,
but
i
wanted
to
see
the
camels
and
elephants
,
so
i
was
on
hand
next
day
,
saturday
,
in
the
ambuscade
;
and
when
we
got
the
word
we
rushed
out
of
the
woods
and
down
the
hill
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
notice
anything
at
first
,
but
next
i
did
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lose
no
time
.
|
|
|
|
sleep
much
.
|
|
|
say
any
more
,
but
i
done
some
thinking
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
do
him
no
more
mean
tricks
,
and
i
wouldn’t
done
that
one
if
i’d
a
knowed
it
would
make
him
feel
that
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wait
for
no
breakfast—i
warn’t
hungry
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
take
notice
nor
let
on
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
look
around
,
but
i
kinder
felt
like
he
was
watching
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mean
no
harm
.
|
|
|
|
mind
the
lickings
,
because
they
didn’t
amount
to
nothing
;
but
i
minded
the
trouble
we
had
to
lay
in
another
lot
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
set
down
again
,
a-shaking
all
over
,
and
got
out
my
pipe
for
a
smoke
;
for
the
house
was
all
as
still
as
death
now
,
and
so
the
widow
wouldn’t
know
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
one
time
back
in
the
woods
,
and
had
a
long
think
about
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
still
and
listened
.
|
|
|
|
the
candle
down
.
|
|
|
|
up
and
looked
around
,
a
little
scared
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
shout—and
then
another—and
then
another
one
;
and
run
this
way
and
that
in
the
woods
,
whooping
and
screeching
;
but
it
warn’t
no
use—old
jim
was
gone
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
,
in
about
six
foot
of
him
,
and
kept
my
eyes
on
him
steady
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
perfectly
still
then
,
listening
to
my
heart
thump
,
and
i
reckon
i
didn’t
draw
a
breath
while
it
thumped
a
hundred
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
waited
,
and
it
seemed
a
good
while
,
everything
was
so
still
and
lonesome
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
till
i
reckoned
he
had
got
a
good
start
;
then
i
out
with
my
saw
,
and
went
to
work
on
that
log
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
clumb
up
the
shed
and
crept
into
my
window
just
before
day
was
breaking
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
says
to
myself
,
if
a
body
can
get
anything
they
pray
for
,
why
don’t
deacon
winn
get
back
the
money
he
lost
on
pork
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
can
fix
it
now
so
nobody
won’t
think
of
following
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
reckon
a
body
that
ups
and
tells
the
truth
when
he
is
in
a
tight
place
is
taking
considerable
many
resks
,
though
i
ain’t
had
no
experience
,
and
can’t
say
for
certain
;
but
it
looks
so
to
me
,
anyway
;
and
yet
here’s
a
case
where
i’m
blest
if
it
don’t
look
to
me
like
the
truth
is
better
and
actuly
safer
than
a
lie
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they’ll
follow
the
track
of
that
sackful
of
rocks
to
the
shore
and
then
drag
the
river
for
me
.
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
there
ain’t
no
telling

i
might
come
to
be
a
murderer
myself
yet
,
and
then
how
would
i
like
it
?

him
rob
her

her
money

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

shall
i
go
to
that
doctor

private
,

blow
on
these
frauds

|
spos’n
he
can’t
fix
that
leg
just
in
three
shakes
of
a
sheep’s
tail
,

the
saying
is
?

the

why

this

put
up
at

sold

now
i
reckon
the
widow

the
parson

somebody
prayed
that
this
bread
would
find
me
,
and
here
it
has
gone

all
right
,
and
was
going
to
start
for
the
raft
;
but
just
then
i
heard
a
voice
wail
out
and
say
:
“oh

look
at
my
hat—if
you
call
it
a
hat—but
the
lid
raises
up
and
the
rest
of
it
goes
down
till
it’s
below
my
chin
,
and
then
it
ain’t
rightly
a
hat
at
all
,
but
more
like
my
head
was
shoved
up
through
a
jint
o’
stove-pipe

you

what
did
you

when
i
fetched
in
the
snake-skin
that
i

on

we

judged
i
could
see
that
there
was
two
providences
,
and
a
poor
chap
would
stand
considerable
show
with
the
widow’s
providence

if
miss
watson’s
got
him
there
warn’t
no

would
saw
out

leave

night

pap
got
drunk
enough

i
reckoned
he
would
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
better
hide
it
outside
of
the
house
somewheres
,
because
if
they
missed
it
they
would
give
the
house
a
good
ransacking
:
i
knowed
that
very
well

the
old
man
would
turn
up
again
by
and
by
,

i
wished
he
wouldn’t
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
had
got
drownded
,

i
wasn’t
ever
going
to
get
out
any
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
be
blind
drunk
in
about
an
hour
,

then
i
would
steal
the
key
,

saw
myself
out
,
one
or
t’other
.

wouldn’t
come
back
that
night

|
they
had
got
to
the
foot
,

was
giving
it
up
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
would
be
proud
of
me
for
helping
these
rapscallions
,
because
rapscallions
and
dead
beats
is
the
kind
the
widow

good
people
takes
the
most

that
that
piece
of
paper
meant
that
miss
sophia
was
to
meet
harney
somewheres
at
half-past
two
and
run
off
;
and
i
judged
i
ought
to
told
her
father
about
that
paper
and
the
curious
way
she
acted
,
and
then
maybe
he
would
a
locked
her
up

the
old
ways

,
but
i
was
getting
so
i
liked
the
new
ones
,
too
,
a
little
bit
.

nigger

reached
for
some
of
it
as
quick
as
i
could
to
throw
over
my
left
shoulder
and
keep
off
the
bad
luck
,
but
miss
watson
was
in
ahead
of
me
,
and
crossed
me
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

started
out
,
after
breakfast
,
feeling
worried
and
shaky
,
and
wondering
where
it
was
going
to
fall
on
me
,
and
what
it
was
going
to
be
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
across
to
the
town
from
a
little
below
the
ferry-landing
,
and
the
drift
of
the
current
fetched
me
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

noticed
the
window
was
up
;
so
he
had
clumb
in
by
the
shed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
some
pieces
of
limbs
and
such
things
floating
down
,
and
a
sprinkling
of
bark
;
so
i
knowed
the
river
had
begun
to
rise
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a-going

and
i
ain’t
a-going
back
there
,
anyways
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
that
happened—it
would
make
me
sick
again
if
i
was
to
do
that
.

|
|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|

borrowed
three
dollars
from
judge

,

pap
took
it
and
got
drunk
,
and
went
a-blowing
around
and
cussing
and
whooping
and
carrying
on
;
and
he
kept
it
up
all
over
town
,
with
a
tin
pan
,
till
most
midnight
;
then
they
jailed
him
,
and
next
day
they
had
him
before
court
,

jailed
him
again
for

guessed
i
wouldn’t
stay
in
one
place
,
but
just
tramp
right
across
the
country
,
mostly
night
times
,
and
hunt
and
fish
to
keep
alive
,
and
so
get
so
far
away
that
the
old
man

the
widow
couldn’t

find
me
any

told
him
i
was
only
huck
;
but
he
laughed
such
a
screechy
laugh
,
and
roared
and
cussed
,
and
kept
on
chasing
me
up
.

slipped
the
ramrod
down
it
to
make
sure
it
was
loaded
,
then
i
laid
it
across
the
turnip
barrel
,
pointing
towards
pap
,
and
set
down
behind
it
to

up

peeped
in
at
the
window
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
bed
,
feeling
ruther
blue
,
on
accounts
of
the
thing
playing
out
that
way
after
i
had
took
so
much
trouble

about

shot
head-first
off
of
the
bank
like
a
frog
,
clothes
and
all
on
,
and
struck
out
for
the
canoe
.

this

took
him
into
camp
.

|
|
|

past
the
head
at
a
ripping
rate
,
the
current
was
so
swift
,
and
then
i
got
into
the
dead
water
and
landed
on
the
side
towards
the
illinois
shore
.

out

went
for
the
doctor’s
house
,
but
they
told
me
he’d
gone
away
in
the
night
some
time
or
other
,
and

back
yet
.

,
and
now
i
was
done
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
pig
in
,
and
took
him
back
nearly
to
the
table
and
hacked
into
his
throat
with
the
axe
,
and
laid
him
down
on
the
ground
to
bleed
;
i
say
ground
because
it
was
ground—hard
packed
,
and
no
boards

a

the
men
to
see
what
they
was
going
to
do
with

;

pap’s
whetstone
there
too
,
so
as
to
look
like
it
had
been
done
by
accident
.

|
|
|
|
|

listened
.
|
|
peeped
out
through
the
willow
branches
,
and
there
it
was—a
skiff
,
away
across
the
water
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
through
a
crack
of

door
,
and

the

watching
the

all
sound
asleep
on
their

up
,
and
there
was
jackson’s
island
,
about
two
mile
and
a
half
down
stream
,
heavy
timbered
and
standing
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
river
,
big
and
dark
and
solid
,
like
a
steamboat
without
any
lights
.

laid
there
in
the
grass
and
the
cool
shade
thinking
about
things
,
and
feeling
rested
and
ruther
comfortable
and
satisfied
.

him
out
in
a
second
with
a
stick
,
and
jim
grabbed

whisky-jug
and
begun
to
pour
it
down
.

hopped
up
,
and
went
and
looked
out
at
a
hole
in
the
leaves
,
and
i
see
a
bunch
of
smoke
laying
on
the
water
a
long
ways
up—about
abreast
the
ferry
.

could
have
,
and
i
warn’t
disappointed
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

crossed
over
to
that
side
and
watched
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
catched
a
catfish
and
haggled
him
open
with
my
saw
,
and
towards
sundown
i
started
my
camp
fire
and
had
supper
.

.

;
and
green
summer

razberries
;
and

in
her

,
which
was
next
to

,
and
she
took
me
in
her
room
and
shut
the
door
very
soft
,
and
asked
me
if
i
liked
her
,
and
i
said
i
did
;
and
she
asked
me
if
i
would
do
something
for

nothing
,
i
didn’t
hear
nothing—i
only
thought
i
heard
and
seen
as
much
as
a
thousand
things
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hain’t
raised
such
a
scamp
as
my
tom
all
these
years
not
to
know
him
when
i
see
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that’s
a
considerble
sight
better
‘n
killin’
of
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i’d
better
put
‘em
on
,
but
i’d
ruther
not
,
it’s
so
warm
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i’ll
cut
it
pretty
short
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
they’re
all
alike
.
|
|
|
|
he
can
stand
a
little
thing
like
that
,
can’t
he
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
he’d
keep
the
thing
up
till
he
tired
them
people
out
,
so
they’d
thin
out
,
and
him
and
the
duke
could
break
loose
and
get
away
.

you
ain’t
used
to
lying
,
it
don’t
seem
to
come
handy
;
what
you
want
is
practice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
wouldn’t
do
no
good
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hadn’t
got
far
when
i
hear
a
man
say
:
“we
better
camp
here
if
we
can
find
a
good
place
;
the
horses
is
about
beat
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
seen
no
house
out
in
the
country
before
that
was
so
nice
and
had
so
much
style
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
yesterday
,
so
jim
he
got
out
some
corn-dodgers
and
buttermilk
,
and
pork
and
cabbage
and
greens—there
ain’t
nothing
in
the
world
so
good
when
it’s
cooked
right—and
whilst
i
eat
my
supper
we
talked
and
had
a
good
time
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tied
up
in
the
old
place
,
and
reckoned
i
would
sleep
in
the
canoe
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
started
along
the
bank
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
poked
along
well
on
to
an
hour
,
everything
still
as
rocks
and
sound
asleep
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
into
the
place
a-ways
and
come
to
a
little
open
patch
as
big
as
a
bedroom
all
hung
around
with
vines
,
and
found
a
man
laying
there
asleep—and
,
by
jings
,
it
was
my
old
jim
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sat
down
there
on
a
log
,
and
looked
out
through
the
leaves
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hain’t
ever
done
no
harm
to
a
ghos’
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
been
here
before
.
|
|
|
|
seen
her
since
that
time
that
i
see
her
go
out
of
that
door
;
no
,
i
hain’t
ever
seen
her
since
,
but
i
reckon
i’ve
thought
of
her
a
many
and
a
many
a
million
times
,
and
of
her
saying
she
would
pray
for
me
;
and
if
ever
i’d
a
thought
it
would
do
any
good
for
me
to
pray
for
her
,
blamed
if
i
wouldn’t
a
done
it
or
bust
.

paddled
over

a
half
a

doing
it
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|

crept
up
the
dead
water
under
the
bank
,
and
hadn’t
no

and
didn’t
see
nobody
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
to

;
they
was
snoring
.
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
killed
him
,
and
curled
him
up
on
the
foot
of
jim’s
blanket
,
ever
so
natural
,
thinking
there’d
be
some
fun
when
jim
found
him
there
.

it
and
said
it
would
help
cure
him
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
of

.
|
|
|
|
.
|
|
|
practiced
around
all
day
to
get
the
hang
of
the
things
,
and
by
and
by
i
could
do
pretty
well
in
them
,
only
jim
said
i
didn’t
walk
like
a
girl
;
and
he
said
i
must
quit
pulling
up
my
gown
to
get
at
my
britches-pocket

|
|
|
|
|
|
got
it
in
the
book—i’ve
only
got
one
volume—but
i
reckon
i
can
piece
it
out
from
memory
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wished
the
woman
would
say
something
more
;
the
longer
she
set
still
the
uneasier
i
was
.
|
|
|
|

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hadn’t
ever
come
ashore
that
night
to
see
such
things
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
held
up
my
two
hands
and
she
put
the
hank
over
them
,
and
went
on
talking
about
her
and
her
husband’s
matters
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
traveled
nights
,
and
hid
daytimes
and
slept
,
and
the
bag
of
bread
and
meat
i
carried
from
home
lasted
me
all
the
way
,
and
i
had
a-plenty
.

|

|
|
|

|
|
jumped
in
,
and
was
off
in
a
hurry
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
into
the
canoe
and
run
back
to
the
stern
,
and
grabbed
the
paddle
and
set
her
back
a
stroke
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
landed
,
and
slopped
through
the
timber
and
up
the
ridge
and
into
the
cavern
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
below
where
i
judged
was
phelps’s
place
,
and
hid
my
bundle
in
the
woods
,
and
then
filled
up
the
canoe
with
water
,
and
loaded
rocks
into
her
and
sunk
her
where
i
could
find
her
again
when
i
wanted
her
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
a
little
steam
sawmill
that
was
on
the
bank

crawfished
as

could
about
two
yards
,
but
the

slanted
so
that

good
time
;

out

and
away
we
went
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
begun
to
think
how
dreadful
it
was
,
even
for
murderers
,
to
be
in
such
a
fix
.
|

about

,
and
how
we
lived
there
,
and
all
about
the
english
wilkses
,
and
so
on
;
but
i
didn’t
get
pretty
fur
till
the
doctor
begun
to
laugh
;
and
levi

,
the
lawyer
,
says
:
“set

would
sneak
out
and
go
for
the
woods
till
the

moderated

skimmed
around
for
the
watchman
,
a-wondering
whereabouts
he
slept
;
and
by
and
by
i
found
him
roosting
on
the
bitts
forward
,
with
his

down

pulled
all
around

hollered
a

,

there

answer
;
all
dead
still

up
and
down

raft
,
abusing
myself
to
myself
,
and
jim

fidgeting
up

down
past
me
.

up
and

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

dived—and
i
aimed
to
find
the
bottom
,
too
,
for
a
thirty-foot
wheel
had
got
to
go
over
me
,
and
i
wanted
it
to
have
plenty
of
room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
popped
out
to
my
armpits
and
blowed
the
water
out
of
my
nose
,
and
puffed
a
bit
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sung
out
for
jim
about
a
dozen
times
,
but
i
didn’t
get
any
answer
;
so
i
grabbed
a
plank
that
touched
me
while
i
was
“treading
water
,”
and
struck
out
for
shore
,
shoving
it
ahead
of
me
.

.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
waked
him
up
,
and
i
reckoned
it
was
going
to
be
a
grand
surprise
to
him
to
see
me
again
,
but
it
warn’t
.

up
about
dawn
,
and
was
a-going
to
turn
over
and
go
to
sleep
again
when
i
noticed
how
still
it
was—didn’t
seem
to
be
anybody
stirring
.

stayed
in
the
tree
till
it
begun
to
get
dark
,
afraid
to
come
down
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cried
a
little
when
i
was
covering
up
buck’s
face
,
for
he
was
mighty
good
to
me
.
|

it
myself
.
|

crawled
into
the
wigwam
,
but
the
king
and
the
duke
had
their
legs
sprawled
around
so
there
warn’t
no
show
for
me
;
so
i
laid
outside—i
didn’t
mind
the
rain
,
because
it
was
warm
,
and
the
waves
warn’t
running
so
high
now
.

smelt
sickly
eggs
by
the
barrel
,
and
rotten
cabbages
,
and
such
things
;
and
if
i
know
the
signs
of

for

but
it
was
too
various
for
me
;
i
couldn’t
stand
it
.

|
|

the

out

said
i

take
up

which
was
in

i

the
old

servant
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stuck
tight
to
the
wall
and
kept
mighty
still
,
though
quivery
;
and
i
wondered
what
them
fellows
would
say
to
me
if
they
catched
me
;
and
i
tried
to
think
what
i’d
better
do
if
they
did
catch
me
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
groped
along
up
to
my
cubby
,
and
hid
it
there
till
i
could
get
a
chance
to
do
better
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tucked
the
money-bag
in
under
the
lid
,
just
down
beyond
where
his
hands
was
crossed
,
which
made
me
creep
,
they
was
so
cold
,
and
then
i
run
back
across
the
room
and
in
behind
the
door
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slid
out
,
and
as
i
passed
the
dining-room
i
thought
i’d
make
sure
them
watchers
hadn’t
seen
me
;
so
i
looked
through
the
crack
,
and
everything
was
all
right
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
come
nigh
getting
caught
,
and
i
had
to
shove
it
into
the
first
place
i
come
to
,
and
run—and
it
warn’t
a
good
place
.
|

i
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
studied
a
minute
,
sort
of
holding
my
breath
,
and
then
says
to
myself
:
“all
right
,
then
,
i’ll
go
to
hell”—and
tore
it
up
.

|
|
|
|

slept
the
night
through
,
and
got
up
before
it
was
light
,
and
had
my
breakfast
,
and
put
on
my
store
clothes
,
and
tied
up
some
others
and
one
thing
or
another
in
a
bundle
,
and
took
the
canoe
and
cleared
for
shore
.

in

lay
you’ll

it
never
sawed
itself
off
,
s’i—somebody
sawed
it
,
s’i
;
that’s
my
opinion
,
take
it
or
leave
it
,
it
mayn’t
be
no
‘count
,
s’i
,
but
sich
as
‘t
is

it’s
my

s’i
,
‘n’
if
any

k’n
start
a

s’i
,
let
him
do

out

,
we
muffled
the
oars
and
hitched
the
raft
on
,
and
towed
her
over
very
nice
and
quiet
,
and
the
nigger
never
made

on

told
her
all
what
i
told
uncle
silas
before
;
and
then
she
said
she’d
forgive
us
,
and
maybe
it
was
all
right
enough
anyway
,
and
about
what
a
body
might
expect
of
boys
,
for
all
boys
was
a
pretty
harum-scarum
lot
as
fur
as
she
could
see
;
and
so
,
as
long
as
no
harm
hadn’t
come
of
it
,
she
judged
she
better
put
in
her
time
being
grateful
we
was
alive

well
and
she
had
us
still

of

got
up

stood
,
and
went
a-weaving
around
the
ring
so
gentle
and
wavy
and
graceful
,
the
men
looking
ever
so
tall
and
airy
and
straight
,
with
their
heads
bobbing
and
skimming
along
,
away
up
there
under
the
tent-roof
,
and
every
lady’s
rose-leafy
dress
flapping
soft
and
silky
around

they
went

all

dancing
,
first
one
foot
out
in

then
the

,
the
horses
leaning
more

awhile

it

not
laying

you
didn’t

burnt

scattered

his

blotted
off

she
turned
over

johnny
used
to
work
in
the
old
gentleman's
mill
,
walking
round
and
round
in

to
drive
the
mill
.

everything
went
on
beautifully
until
johnny
came
in
sight
of
king
billy's
statue
:
and
whether
he
fell
in
love
with
the
horse
king
billy
sits
on
or
whether
he
thought
he
was
back
again
in
the
mill
,
anyhow
he
began
to
walk
round
the
statue
.

that
was
said
at
the
time
was
uninteresting
,
unjust
,
and
stupid
;
he
felt
irritated
and
disturbed
,
but
held
his
tongue
,
and
,
because
he
sat
glumly
silent
and
looked
at
his
plate
,
he
was
nicknamed
in
the
town
"the
haughty
pole
,"
though
he
never
had
been
a
pole

began
to
feel
very
curious
to
see
how
these
two
creatures
would
get
on
together
in
one
flat—she
,
domestic
and
home-loving
with
her
copper
saucepans
and
her
dreams
of
a
good
cook
and
horses
;
and
he
,
fond
of
saying
to
his
friends
that
a
decent
and
orderly
man's
flat
ought
,
like
a
warship
,
to
have
nothing
in
it
superfluous—no
women
,
no
children

no
rags

no
kitchen
utensils

trembled
to
think
that
my

already

me
in

orter
,
too—a

|

you
,

everybody

about

up

explained
all
about
how
we
blowed
out
a
cylinder-head
at
the
mouth
of
white
river
,
and
it
took
us
three
days
to
fix
it
.

did
start
to
tell
him
;

he
shut
me
up

says

“don’t
you

i

i’m
about

,
you

ther’
ain’t
no

in

while
tom’s

polly
shook
herself
loose

stood
there
looking

the

and
the
birch-trees

and
the
quiet
atmosphere
all
around

the
fields

seemed
preparing
,
like
the
workpeople

there

it

judged
of
others
by
himself
,
not
believing

believing

real

most

could
think

nothing
more

|

remembered
all
that
had
been
,
every
minute
detail
;
how
he
had
wandered
about
the
cemetery
,
how
he
had
returned
home
in
the
morning
exhausted

he

made
up
his

that
he
really
must
go

|
|
|

hugged
the

stroking

there’d
be

trial
to
get
me
away
from

give
me
to
the

if

that

the
bees
must
be
told

it

handling

there
warn’t
no

him

skasely
;

when
there
was
,
a
body
couldn’t
sleep
,
it
was
so
lively
,
and
it
was
always
lively
,
he
said
,
because
they
never
all
slept
at
one
time
,
but
took
turn
about
,
so
when
the
snakes
was
asleep
the
rats
was
on
deck
,
and
when
the
rats
turned
in
the
snakes
come
on
watch
,
so
he
always
had
one
gang
under
him
,
in
his
way
,
and
t’other
gang
having
a
circus
over
him
,
and
if
he
got
up
to
hunt
a
new
place
the
spiders
would
take
a
chance
at
him

he
crossed

for

have
adventures
plumb
to
the
mouth
of
the

then
tell
him
about
his
being
free
,
and
take
him
back
up
home
on
a
steamboat
,
in
style
,
and
pay
him
for
his
lost
time
,
and
write
word
ahead
and
get
out
all
the
niggers
around
,
and
have
them
waltz
him
into
town
with
a
torchlight
procession
and
a
brass-band
,

then
he
would
be

would
we

the

that
was

he
got
every

to
know
all
about
it
right
off
,
because
it
was
a
grand
adventure

,

it

him

only
a

in

he
died

at

watched
orlov
sipping
his
coffee
,
i
felt
not

tittle-tattle
came
to
the

he

drop
his

shake
his

away
on

i
went
back
to
the

,
hardly
conscious
of
what
i
was
doing
,
took
up
the

to
shake
off
that
semi-delirium
i
peeped
out
from
the

and
saw
the
dawn
,
all
the
images
of
the
past
,
all
my
misty
thoughts
,
for
some
reason
,
blended
in
me
into
one
distinct

overpowering
thought

everything
was
irrevocably

it

the

rose
up

held
out

the

all
went

then
i
come
in
and
told
her
the
noise
and
shooting
waked
up
me
and
“sid
,”
and
the
door
was
locked
,
and
we
wanted
to
see
the
fun
,
so
we
went
down
the
lightning-rod
,
and
both
of
us
got
hurt
a
little
,

we
didn’t
never
want
to
try

no

they
bent

took
one
sight
,
and
then
they
bust
out
a-crying
so
you
could
a
heard
them
to
orleans
,
most
;
and
then
they
put
their
arms
around
each
other’s
necks
,
and
hung
their
chins
over
each
other’s
shoulders
;
and
then
for

i

she
went

cracking
the

several
times
a

from

lived
in

since
her
marriage
two
years

that
she

two
peculiarities
of

very

the

there

the
lions
now
,
fifteen
feet
away
,
so
real
,
so
feverishly
and
startlingly
real
that
you
could
feel
the
prickling
fur
on
your
hand
,
and
your
mouth
was
stuffed
with
the
dusty
upholstery
smell
of
their
heated
pelts
,
and
the
yellow
of
them
was
in
your
eyes
like
the
yellow
of
an
exquisite
french
tapestry
,
the
yellows
of
lions
and
summer
grass
,
and
the
sound
of
the
matted
lion
lungs
exhaling
on
the
silent
noontide
,

the
smell

meat

about
forty-five

bareheaded

her
spinning-stick
in

sounds
:
the
thump
of
distant
antelope
feet
on
grassy
sod
,
the
papery
rustling
of
vultures
.

i’m
asking
you
:
should
such
a
life’s
work
,”
he
pointed
to
the
machine
,
“come
to
nothing
because
of
this
commandant
and
the
women
influencing
him
?

you—help
me
with
the
commandant
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he’s
speaking
:
‘a
great
western
explorer
who
has
been
commissioned
to
inspect
judicial
procedures
in
all
countries
has
just
said
that
our
process
based
on
old
customs
is
inhuman
.

he
cannot
restrain
himself
.
|
|
|
|
|
finally
come
your
remarks
.
|
|
|
|
|
you're
letting
them
down
in
some
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
you
come
along
and
want
to
shut
it
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
in
this
constancy
,
in
this
complete
indifference
to
the
life
and
death
of
each
of
us
,
there
lies
hid
,
perhaps
,
a
pledge
of
our
eternal
salvation
,
of
the
unceasing
movement
of
life
upon
earth
,
of
unceasing
progress
towards
perfection
.

any
case
it
would
be
tactless

go
into
the
house

upset
her
.

the
stillness
of
the
night
it
seemed
as
though
these
sounds
were
uttered
by
a
monster
with
crimson
eyes—the
devil
himself
,
who
controlled
the
owners
and
the
work-people
alike
,
and
was
deceiving
both

was
something

often
in
the
square

when
there
was

there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
talk
vaguely
of
love
,
of
woman
,
and
no
one
guessed
what
it
meant
;
only
his
wife
twitched
her
black
eyebrows
,
and
said
:
"the

perfectly

really
was
in
his
long
figure
,
his
side-whiskers
,
and
the
small
bald
patch
on
his
head
,
something
of
the
flunkey's
obsequiousness
;
his
smile
was
sugary
,
and
in
his
buttonhole
there
was
some
badge
of
distinction

through
some
strange
,
perhaps
accidental
,
conjunction
of
circumstances
,
everything
that
was
essential
,
of
interest
and
of
value
to
him
,
everything
in
which
he
was
sincere
and
did
not
deceive
himself
,
everything
that
made
the
kernel
of
his
life
,
was
hidden
from
other
people
;
and
all
that
was
false
in
him
,
the
sheath
in
which
he
hid
himself
to
conceal
the
truth—such
,
for
instance
,
as
his
work
in
the
bank
,
his
discussions
at
the
club
,
his
"lower
race
,"
his
presence
with
his
wife
at
anniversary
festivities—all
that
was
open

it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
had
grown
so
much
older
,
so
much
plainer
during
the
last
few
years
.

me
that
zinaida

not

it
vexed
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
seems
that
the
thousand
years
is
almost
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
really
was
hot
and
oppressive
,
and
it
would
not
have
been
amiss
to
have
a
bathe
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

would
not
be
difficult
for
the
opportunity
to
occur
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
is
only
in
that
way
that
we
succeed
in
deceiving
one
another
,
and
fancying
that
we
are
in
love
and
happy
.

that
dread
,
together
with
lack
of
practice
,
that
prevents
me
from
being
able
to
express
with
perfect
clearness
what
was
passing
in
my
soul
at
that
time

it

.

was
clearly
indicated
that
the
children
had
been
spending
a
little
too
much
time
on
africa
.

weeks

‘ll
be
the
third
i’ve
made
in
two
years
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
only
now
when
his
head
was
grey
he
had
fallen
properly
,
really
in
love—for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
suddenly
from
outside
came
harsh
,
abrupt
,
metallic
sounds
,
such
as
korolyov
had
never
heard
before
,
and
which
he
did
not
understand
now
;
they
roused
strange
,
unpleasant
echoes
in
his
soul
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

she
turned
her
eyes
on
polya
and
looked
at
her
intently
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
realized
why
those
other
screams
bad
sounded
familiar
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
there
are
the
three
of
us
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
appears
that
all
these
five
blocks
of
buildings
are
at
work
,
and
inferior
cotton
is
sold
in
the
eastern
markets
,
simply
that
christina
dmitryevna
may
eat
sterlet
and
drink
madeira
.

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
makes
it
so
rotten
difficult
to
get
up
a
difficult
plan
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
turned
out
,
and
he
let
on
to
be
sid
,
and
made
things
as
soft
as
he
could
for
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
great
is
the
effect
of
giving
up
a
habit
,
the
cigar
and
the
two
gulps
of
wine
made
him
giddy
,
and
brought
on
palpitations
of
the
heart
,
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
bromide
.

|
|
|
|
on
.
|
|
not
to
live
in
the
same
flat
with
the
woman
who
loves
you
is
to
deny
her
her
exalted
vocation
and
to
refuse
to
share
her
ideals
.

|
|
all
this
business
of
moving
,
of
saucepans
,
hopes
of
eternal
love
and
harmony
,
are
nothing
but
a
desire
to
delude
herself
and
me
.

,
as
i

it

summed

i
kept
veering
about
.
|
|
|
|
found
him
there
,
standing
all
alone
in
the
quietest
of
the
yards
,
his
face
towards
a
high
wall
,
while
all
around
,
from
the
narrow
slits
of
the
jail
windows
,
i
thought
i
saw
peering
out
upon
him
the
eyes
of
murderers
and
thieves

one
after

they
all
skipped
off
into
the
ring
,
and
made
the
sweetest
bow
i
ever
see
,
and
then
scampered
out
,
and
everybody
clapped
their

went
just
about
wild

up

went
warbling

warbling
right
along

he
was
actuly
beginning
to
believe
what

was
saying
himself
;

pretty
soon
the

broke
in

grabbed
a

of
dozen
garters

house-snakes
,

put
them
in
a
bag
,

put
it
in

it

the

took
up

six

he
,
too
,
was
told

i
keep
gazing
at
the
long
striped
rug
that
stretches
the
whole
length
of
the
corridor
,
the
idea
occurs
to
me
that
i
am
playing
in
the
life
of
this
woman
a
strange
,
probably
false
part

the
idea
came
upon
me
of
his
possibly
turning
out
a
long-lived
man
,
and
keep
occupying
my
chambers
,
and
denying
my
authority
;
and
perplexing
my
visitors
;
and
scandalizing
my
professional
reputation
;
and
casting
a
general
gloom
over
the
premises
;
keeping
soul
and
body
together
to
the
last
upon
his
savings
(for
doubtless
he
spent
but
half
a
dime
a
day)
,
and
in
the
end
perhaps
outlive
me
,
and
claim
possession
of
my
office
by
right
of
his
perpetual
occupancy
:
as
all
these
dark
anticipations
crowded
upon
me
more
and
more
,
and
my
friends
continually
intruded
their
relentless
remarks
upon
the
apparition
in
my
room
;
a
great
change
was
wrought
in
me

the

here

the
plain

slapping
me
in
the
face

letting

being

understanding

loved

with

of
course
i
didn't
understand
you
then
,
but
afterwards
in
moscow
i
often
thought
of
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
what's
here
?
|
|
|
kitten
plays
the
piano
for
four
hours
every
day
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
kovrin
followed
her
and
went
on
talking
,
with
the
same
radiant
,
enthusiastic
face
:
"i
want
a
love
that
will
dominate
me
altogether
;
and
that
love
only
you
,
tanya
,
can
give
me
.

|
,
as
ill-luck
would
have
it
,
visitors
came
every
day
,
who
had
to
be
entertained
,
fed
,
and
even
put
up
for
the
night
.
|

indeed
,
his
head
was
closely
cropped
,
his
beautiful
long
hair
was
gone
,
his
step
was
lagging
,
his
face
was
fuller
and
paler
than
last
summer
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

she
had
noticed
before
that
there
was
something
lacking
in
his
face
,
as
though
ever
since
his
hair
had
been
cut
his
face
had
changed
,
too
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|

not
need
my
answer
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
if
you
please
,
vladimir
ivanitch
,
another
time
you
want
to
come
into
my
room
,
be
so
good
as
to
give
a
knock
at
the
door
.

still
with
them
,
he
came
around
a
turn
in
the
trail
and
found
him-
self
lying
in
the
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
besides
,
he
said
them
little
birds
had
said
it
was
going
to
rain
,
and
did
i
want
the
things
to
get
wet
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
body
couldn’t
breathe
and
hear
such
talk
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i’ve
already
told
‘em
to
put
on
another
plate
when
i
see
you
coming
;
so
you
mustn’t
disappoint
us
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mind
you
,
when
a
girl
tries
to
catch
anything
in
her
lap
she
throws
her
knees
apart
;
she
don’t
clap
them
together
,
the
way
you
did
when
you
catched
the
lump
of
lead
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
everybody
was
doing
the
same
;
and
the
place
was
that
damp
i
never
see
anything
like
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
then
,
there
he
was
,
slim
and
handsome
,
and
dressed
the
gaudiest
and
prettiest
you
ever
saw
,
and
he
lit
into
that
horse
with
his
whip
and
made
him
fairly
hum—and
finally
skipped
off
,
and
made
his
bow
and
danced
off
to
the
dressing-room
,
and
everybody
just
a-howling
with
pleasure
and
astonishment
.

you
go
on

thinking
,
thinking
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slow
and
still
the
time
did
drag
along
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
far
a
body
can
hear
on
the
water
such
nights
!

glad

grateful

worse
;
for
luck’s
against
us
,
and
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
,
and
when
i
see
that
truck
i
thought
we’d
lost
you
,
for
i
knowed
by
the
color
and
all
it
was
just
like
your
brains
would
be
if—dear
,
dear
,
whyd’nt
you
tell
me
that
was
what
you’d
been
down
there
for

|
|
|
|
without
his
will's
having
any
part
in
his
action
,
without
reflection
or
understanding
,
he
took
half
a
step
towards
nyuta
and
clutched
her
by
the
arm
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

you

he
has
a
way
with
him
!
|
|

|
may
well
,
you
may
well
dread
the
sight
of
tears
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
?
|
must
be
as
polite
to
him
as
possible
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can’t
get
away
with
that
tooth
without
fetching
the
whole
harrow
along
,
can
you
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wouldn’t
leave
them
any
?
|
|
|

|
want
to
water
it
with
your
tears
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
could
hear
her
whoop
to
jericho
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
won’t
go
?
|
|
|
|
maman
laughed
!
|
|
|
soon
afterwards
he
heard
the
lowing
of
the
cows
and
the
sounds
of
the
shepherd's
pipe
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
orlov
was
still
out
of
humour
;
he
was
obviously
restraining
himself
not
to
vent
his
ill-temper
aloud
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
played
with
her
chestnut
hair
and
kissed
her
hands
,
noiselessly
pressing
them
to
his
lips
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

|
that
horrible
,
insolent
servant
,"
she
went
on
,
sobbing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
only
just
escaped
with
his
life
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
ain’t
the
wust
.
|
|
|
|
letter
was
all
they
could
get
him
to
put
a
pen
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
is
,
there’s
a
nigger
here
that
i’m
a-trying
to
steal
out
of
slavery
,
and
his
name
is
jim—old
miss
watson’s
jim
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
what
he
done
.
|
|
|
|
|
gave
him
another
idea
,
and
he
says
:
“borrow
a
shirt
,
too
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
for
some
reason
all
the
restaurant
dainties
on
the
table
struck
me
as
poor
,
thievish
,
like
polya
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
(nippers’s)
part
,
this
was
the
first
and
the
last
time
he
would
do
another
man’s
business
without
pay
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
starter
i
would
go
to
work
and
steal
jim
out
of
slavery
again
;
and
if
i
could
think
up
anything
worse
,
i
would
do
that
,
too
;
because
as
long
as
i
was
in
,
and
in
for
good
,
i
might
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
.

she
called
after
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
not
he
,
i
thought
,
looking
at
his
little
honeyed
face
,
this
very
evening
at
cards
pretend
and
perhaps
declare
that
he
had
already
won

from

in

evening

|
reckoned
the
niggers
stole
it
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
can
send
it
to
him
in
a
pie
;
it’s
mostly
done
that
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
done
it
elegant
,
too
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
to
steal
candles
,
and
the
sheet
,
and
the
shirt
,
and
your
dress
,
and
spoons
,
and
tin
plates
,
and
case-knives
,
and
the
warming-pan
,
and
the
grindstone
,
and
flour
,
and
just
no
end
of
things
,
and
you
can’t
think
what
work
it
was
to
make
the
saws
,
and
pens
,
and
inscriptions
,
and
one
thing
or
another
,
and
you
can’t

half

fun
it
was

anna
pavlovna
could
scarcely
walk

meanwhile
the
band
was
playing
and
the
darkness
was
full
of
the
most
rousing
,

dance-tunes
.

is
.

yet
,
when
he
touched
his
nose

there
was
no
feeling

|
|

you
know
,
it’s
kind
of
natural
to

up

anything
private

he
made
a
mighty
fuss
,
one
day
,
after
that
,
when
i
stole
a
watermelon
out
of
the
nigger-patch
and
eat
it
;
and
he
made
me
go
and
give
the
niggers
a
dime
without
telling
them
what
it
was
for
.

still
later
it
moved
close
to
the
man
and
caught
the
smell
of
death
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thus
,
in
a
manner
,
privacy

society
were
conjoined
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
more
than
all
,
i
remembered
a
certain
unconscious
air
of
pallid—how
shall
i
call
it
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

:
they’ve
got
to

it

you
understand

next
time
jim
told
it
he
said
they
rode
him
down
to
new
orleans
;
and
,
after
that
,
every
time
he
told
it
he
spread
it
more
and
more
,
till
by
and
by
he
said
they
rode
him
all
over
the
world
,
and
tired
him
most
to
death
,
and
his
back
was
all
over
saddle-boils

nobody
that
didn’t

the

could
use
that
mark

if

he
must

what’s
more—if
i
was
one
of
them
i
would
see
a
man
in
jericho
before
i
would
drop
my
business
and
come
to
him
for
the
rubbing
of
an
old
tin
lamp

after
supper
he
talked
to
him
about
temperance
and
such
things
till
the
old
man
cried
,
and
said
he’d
been
a
fool
,
and
fooled
away
his
life
;
but
now
he
was
a-going
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
be
a
man
nobody
wouldn’t
be
ashamed
of
,
and
he
hoped
the
judge
would
help
him
and
not
look
down
on
him
.

they
got
a

quiet
again
she
says

“why

i
never

such
a
surprise

i
says

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|

a
minute
,
he
says

“how’d
you
say
he
got
shot
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they’ll
follow
that
meal
track
to
the
lake
and
go
browsing
down
the
creek
that
leads
out
of
it
to
find
the
robbers
that
killed
me
and
took
the
things
.

a
noble
good
time

every
time
i
waked
up
i
thought
somebody
had
me
by
the
neck
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
second
or
two
there’d
come
a
glare
that
lit
up
the
white-caps
for
a
half
a
mile
around
,
and
you’d
see
the
islands
looking
dusty
through
the
rain
,
and
the
trees
thrashing
around
in
the
wind
;
then
comes
a
h-whack

jim
said
you
mustn’t
count
the
things
you
are
going
to
cook
for
dinner
,
because
that
would
bring

hundred
dollars

jim
chained
by
one
leg
,
with
a
ten-foot
chain
,
to
the
leg
of
his
bed
:
why
,
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
lift
up
the
bedstead

slip
off
the
chain
.

don’t
go
about
women
in

old
calico
.

you
fool

reckon
they’ll

look
when

unloads
the
pan—something
might

,
i
don’t

call
it
mullen

call
it

its
right
name
when
it’s
in
a
prison
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wouldn’t
he
throw

yit
if
we
hadn’t
got
the
best
of
him

him
he’d
a
killed

don’t
you
hurry—come
mighty
slow
.
|
|
|

|
|
did
the
sad
hearts
thicken
,
and
did
the

cry
?

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

warn’t
the
cooking
good

pretty
soon
you’d
hear

loafer
sing
out
,
“hi

|
|
|
|
|
by
and
by
a
drunk
man
tried

get
into

ring—said
he
wanted
to
ride
;
said
he
could
ride
as
well
as
anybody
that

had
me
up
to
tell
what
i
knowed

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
the
old
man
says
:

|
|
|
|

everybody
crowded
up
with
the
tears
in
their
eyes
,
and
most
shook
the

off
of

saying
all

before
i
could

she
throws
her

around

my
heart
swelled
up
sudden
,
like
to
bust
;
and
the
same
second
the
house
and
all
was
behind
me
in
the
dark
,
and
wasn’t
ever
going

be
before
me
no

thinking
over
our
trip
down
the
river
;
and
i
see
jim
before
me
all
the
time
:
in
the
day
and
in
the
night-time
,
sometimes
moonlight
,
sometimes
storms
,
and
we
a-floating
along
,
talking

laughing

behind
the
woman
comes
a
little
nigger
girl
and
two
little
nigger
boys
without
anything
on
but
tow-linen
shirts
,
and
they
hung
on
to
their
mother’s
gown
,
and
peeped
out
from
behind
her
at
me
,
bashful
,
the

he
steps
in

sings
out

there
in

dimmish
light
,
here
comes
a
couple
of
the
hounds
bulging
in
from
under
jim’s
bed
;
and
they
kept
on
piling
in
till
there
was
eleven
of

there

it’s
usual
for
the
prisoner’s
mother
to
change

with
him

she
stays

twice
i
went
down
the
rod
away
in
the
night

slipped
around

,
and
see
her
setting
there
by
her
candle
in
the
window
with
her
eyes
towards
the
road
and
the
tears
in
them
;
and
i
wished
i
could
do
something
for
her
,
but
i
couldn’t
,
only
to
swear
that
i
wouldn’t
never
do
nothing

grieve
her
any

touched

indoors
and
drank
tea
out
of
old-fashioned
china
cups
,
with
cream
and
satisfying
krendels
made
with
milk
and
eggs
;
and
these
trifles
reminded
kovrin
again
of
his
childhood
and

us
:
she—the
ill-fated
,
the
abandoned
;
and
i—the
faithful
,
devoted
friend
,
the
dreamer
,
and
,
if
you
like
it
,
a
superfluous
man
,
a
failure
capable
of
nothing
but
coughing
and
dreaming
,
and
perhaps
sacrificing
myself
.

she
and
julia
had
always
seemed
a
little
proud
of
their
serious
and
matronly
sister
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
were
silent
.
|
|
out
of
breath
,
carrying
two
trunks
and
a
dress-basket
.

the
bed

their

soon
the
roads
would
be
snowed
over
,
impassable
until
spring
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
telephone
in
the
cabin
was
ringing
with
calls
from
clients
,
and
his
guiding
season
was
on
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
steps
stopped
and
something
white
gleamed
in
the
entrance
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
entire
wheel
appeared
.
|
|
|
|
|
her
sudden
and
ravenous
appetite
for
books
could
not
be
met
by
the
great
falls
public
library
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
discussed
it
everywhere—in
the
supermarket
,
at
the
gasoline
pumps
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
perhaps
,
he
would
be
sitting
in
that
same
drawing-room
,
dressed
in
black
,
his
silk
hat
on
his
knees
.

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
after
midday
he
took
his
portfolio
,
full
of
papers
,
and
drove
to
his
office
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
midnight
they
went
to
bed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
at
his
one-room
cabin
,
with
furs
and
old
rifles
on
the
walls
,
he
unbolted
the
door
to
the
crawl
space
and
showed
her
his
winter
hoard
:
a
hundred
smoked
trout
,
plucked
pheasants
and
venison
quarters
hanging
frozen
from
hooks
.

times
he
thought
he
was
a
wolf
,
and
at
times
he
thought
he
was
dead
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bent
down—at
other
times
he
stretched
up
,
all
the
time
pointing
with
his
forefinger
in
order
to
show
something
to
the
soldier
.

first
they
spoke
of
it
only
in
their
basements
,
at
night
,
but
great
falls
was
not
a
big
town
,
and
this
was
not
something
one
could
keep
locked
in
a
basement

mr

yegor
semyonitch
went
about
looking
sulky
and
dignified
,
as
though
to
give
every
one
to
understand
that
for
him
the
claims
of
justice
and
good
order
were
more
important
than
anything
else
in
the
world
;
but
he
could
not
keep
it
up
for
long
,
and
soon
sank
into
depression
.

i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
moneylenders
,
gruzin's
creditors
,
who
sometimes
used
to
come
to
orlov
for
small
payments
on
account
;
but
when
he
came
into
the
hall
and
flung
open
his
coat
,
i
saw
the
thick
brows
and
the
characteristically
compressed
lips
which
i
knew
so
well
from
the
photographs
,
and
two
rows
of
stars
on
the
uniform

their
charming
and
affectionate
relations
had
changed
so
abruptly
,
tanya
huddled
up
to
her
father
and
looked
anxiously
in
his
face
;
she
wanted
to
understand
and
could
not
understand
,
and
all
that
was
clear
to
her
was
that
their
relations
were
growing
worse
and
worse
every
day
,
that
of
late
her
father
had
begun
to
look
much
older
,
and
her
husband
had
grown
irritable
,
capricious
,
quarrelsome
and
uninteresting

seized

held
in

leaving

listening
attentively
,
he
understood
:
a
maiden
,
full
of
sick
fancies
,
heard
one
night
in
her
garden
mysterious
sounds
,
so
strange
and
lovely
that
she
was
obliged
to
recognise
them
as
a
holy
harmony
which
is
unintelligible
to
us
mortals
,
and
so
flies
back
to

he

at

called
timidly

|
|
|
|
|

laughing
aloud
,
she
called

ran
out

familiarly
drawing
my

behind

i
sat
down

said
:
“bartleby

never
mind
then
about

let
me
entreat
you

come
and
begun
to
ask
me
questions
,
but
i
couldn’t
answer
them
straight
,
i
didn’t
know
which
end
of
me
was
up
;
because
these
men
was
in
such
a
fidget
now
that
some
was
wanting
to
start
right
now
and
lay
for
them
desperadoes
,
and
saying
it
warn’t
but
a
few
minutes
to
midnight
;
and
others
was
trying
to
get
them
to
hold
on
and
wait
for
the
sheep-signal
;
and
here
was
aunty
pegging
away
at
the
questions
,
and
me
a-shaking
all
over
and
ready
to
sink
down
in
my
tracks
i
was
that
scared
;
and
the
place
getting
hotter
and
hotter
,
and
the
butter
beginning
to
melt
and
run
down
my
neck
and
behind
my
ears
;
and
pretty
soon
,
when
one
of
them
says
,
“i’m
for
going
and
getting
in
the
cabin
first
and
right
now
,
and
catching
them
when
they
come
,”
i
most
dropped
;
and
a
streak
of
butter
come
a-trickling
down
my
forehead
,
and
aunt
sally
she
see
it
,
and
turns
white
as

then
such
another
crowding

shouldering

shoving
as
there
was

to
scrouge
in

get
a
sight
,
you

such
joy
would
swoop
down
upon
her
that
she
longed
to
fly
away
to
the
clouds
and
there
pray
to
god
,
at
another
moment
she
would
remember
that
in

she
would
have
to
part
from
her
home
and
leave
her
father
;
or
,
goodness

why
,
the
idea
would
occur
to
her
that
she
was
worthless—insignificant
and
unworthy
of
a
great
man
like
kovrin—and
she
would
go
to
her
room
,
lock
herself
in
,
and
cry
bitterly
for
several

went
about
in
a
loose
wrapper

in
a
blouse
with
extremely
full
folds
over
the
bosom
,
and
when
she
went
out
anywhere
she
laced
herself
in
so
tightly
that
on

she
fainted

that
moment
an
army
doctor
passed
,
and
saw
how
i
was
beating
the
man
,
but
he
merely
looked
at
us
in
astonishment

went
on
.

he
had
nothing
to
think
about
except
that
he
would
eat
lunch
at
the
stream’s
divide
and
that
at
six
o’clock
he
would
be
in
camp
with

all

i
saw
that
go
he

not

he
would
do
no
copying
.
|

if
nothing

upon
,
the

about
eleven
o’clock
though
,
in
the
morning
,
i
noticed
that
ginger
nut
would
advance
toward
the
opening
in
bartleby’s
screen

silently
beckoned
thither

any
rate
,
upon
the
occasion
in

i

my

construing

here
in

small

deep

sandy
valley
,
closed
in
on
all
sides
by
barren
slopes
,
apart
from
the
officer
and
the
traveler
there
were
present
only
the
condemned
,
a
vacant-looking
man
with
a
broad
mouth
and
dilapidated
hair
and
face
,
and
the
soldier
,
who
held
the
heavy
chain
to
which
were
connected
the
small
chains
which
bound
the
condemned
man
by
his
feet
and
wrist
bones
,
as
well
as
by

neck

"he's
on
his
back

the
hunter
whispered
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
really
an
awful
bother
,
what
with
green
shades
for
tom's
eyes
at
night
and
making
him
do
the
dumb-bells
,
and
forcing
eva
to
eat
the
stirabout
.

said

"it

"this

says
his
mother
,
getting
up
from

table
and
flinging
down
her
dinner-napkin
.

torture
,"
she
said
,
and
from
her
voice
it
was
evident
that
she
was
utterly
exhausted
,
and
that
it
was
hard
for
her
to
speak
.

|
|
"hush
,"
he
whispered
.
|
|
|
|
|
as
he
watched
,
horrified
,
she
turned
and
placed
both
hands
,
spread-fingered
,
in
the
thick
shag
of
the
bear's
chest
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fell
into
sleep
,
he
watched
himself
as
from
a
distance
,
weeping
and
clutching
his
near-frozen
wife
.

|
|

passed
in
the
way
of
the
cheval-glass
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
full
length
,
his
broad
,
well-filled
shirt-front
,
the
face
whose
expression
always
puzzled
him
when
he
saw
it
in
a
mirror
,
and
his
glimmering
gilt-rimmed
eyeglasses
.

got
into
bed
he
thought
how
lately
she
had
been
a
girl
at
school
,
doing
lessons
like
his
own
daughter
;
he
recalled
the
diffidence
,
the
angularity
,
that
was
still
manifest
in
her
laugh
and
her
manner
of
talking
with
a
stranger
.

eats
his
supper
,
he
turns
round
from
time
to
time
and
puts
in
his
spoke
in
some
conversation
:
"what
are
you
talking
about
?

passes
the
weeping
fedya
he
stops
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
turned
to
go
,
he
forced
some
water
from
his
mouth
as
an
experiment
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
of
lunch
,
he
pressed
his
hand
against
the
package
under
his
jacket
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
walked
along
he
rubbed
his
face
and
nose
with
the
back
of
his
mittened
hand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
laughed
,
he
noted
the
numbness
in
his
bare
fingers
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
held
it
,
he
noticed
some
feeling
in
his
hand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
about
him
,
his
eyes
noticed
the
dog
sitting
across
the
ruins
of
the
fire
from
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sat
and
regained
his
breath
,
he
noted
that
he
was
feeling
warm
and
comfortable
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
began
to
demonstrate
with
both
hands
at
the
mouth
of
the
outlet
pipe
,
in
order
to
make
his
account
as
clear
as
possible
,
the
traveler
raised
his
head
and
,
feeling
behind
him
with
his
hand
,
wanted
to
return
to
his
chair
.

this
,
the
two
lady’s
handkerchiefs
,
which
he
had
pushed
into
the

fell
into

now
done
all
that
i
possibly
could
,
both
in

to
the
demands
of
the
landlord

his

with

ivan

from

do
so
for

the

down

there
was
a

restless
;
in

row
the

standing
up

in

the
governor's

wearing

was
sitting
in
the
front
seat
,
while
the
governor
himself
lurked
modestly
behind
the
curtain

only
his

visible

the

a

judging

complaints
,
the
radical
cause

which
was
incomprehensible

,
he
looked
upon
factories
as
something
baffling

the
cause
of
which
also
was
obscure
and
not
removable
,
and
all
the
improvements
in
the
life
of
the

hands
he
looked

worked
in
the
morning
,
cleaning
boots
or
sweeping
the
rooms
,
i
waited
with
a
thrill
at
my
heart
for
the
moment
when
i
should
hear
her
voice
and
her
footsteps
.

on

.

went
by
i
see
it
was
a
lantern
hanging
on
the
jackstaff
of
a
double-hull
ferryboat
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

sprung
aboard

sung
out
:
“out

we
were
unpacking
the
tea
service
polya's
eyes
gleamed
,
and
she
looked
at
me
two
or
three
times
with
hatred
and
fear
that
i
,
not
she
,
would
be
the
first
to
steal
one
of
these
charming
cups
.

by
our

i
wished
i
hadn’t
sent
mary
jane
out

;
because
now
if
i
could
tip
her
the

she’d
light
out

save

passing

the
old
man
he
took
up
his
hat
,
and
the
shingle-nail
fell
out
on
the
floor
,
and
he
just
merely
picked
it
up

laid
it
on
the
mantel-shelf
,
and
never
said
nothing
,

went

the

for

easing

he
brought
the

up

wrote
there
like

regarded
every

management

turned

even
a

noble
passion
springs
up

dies
away
in
impotence
,
turned
to
no

misunderstood

their
heads—it
was

another
one
was

is
shy
of
asking
men
under
sentence
what
they
have
been
sentenced
for
;
and
in
the
same
way
it
is
awkward
to
ask
very
rich
people
what
they
want
so
much
money
for
,
why
they
make
such
a
poor
use
of
their
wealth
,
why
they
don't
give
it
up
,
even
when
they
see
in
it
their
unhappiness
;
and
if
they
begin
a
conversation
about
it
themselves
,
it
is
usually
embarrassing
,
awkward
,
and
long
.

lovely

graceful
trees

strong
,
straight
stems

,

it

only

these

grey
morning
when
we
both
stood
at
my
window
,
looking
at
the
clouds
which
were
moving
up
from
the
sea
,
and
at
the
darkening
canal
,
expecting
every
minute
that
it
would
pour
with
rain
,
and
when
a
thick
,
narrow
streak
of
rain
covered
the
sea
as
though
with
a
muslin
veil
,
we
both
felt
suddenly
dreary

morning
when
i
went
into
her
room
she
was
sitting
on
a
low
chair
,
bent
together
and
huddled
up
,
with
her
legs
crossed
and
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands

to
turn
over
the
salt-cellar
at
breakfast
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
about
daybreak
i
found
a
canoe
and
crossed
over
a
chute
to
the
main
shore—it
was
only
two
hundred
yards—and
paddled
about
a
mile
up
a
crick
amongst
the
cypress
woods
,
to
see
if
i
couldn’t
get
some
berries
.

,
when
we
was
pretty
well
down
the
state
of
arkansaw
,
we
come
in
sight
of
a
little
one-horse
town
in
a
big
bend
;
so
we
tied
up
about
three-quarters
of
a
mile
above
it
,
in
the
mouth
of
a
crick
which
was
shut
in
like
a
tunnel
by
the
cypress
trees
,
and
all
of
us
but
jim
took
the
canoe
and
went
down
there
to
see
if
there
was
any
chance
in
that
place
for
our
show

at

dreaming
of

life
of
luxury

gaiety
,
and
never
doubting
that

the

surely
be

then
a

move
up

fall

,
which
he
called
a
slogan
(which
was
the
sign
for
the
gang
to
get
together)
,
and
then
he
said
he
had
got
secret
news
by
his
spies
that
next
day
a
whole
parcel
of
spanish
merchants
and
rich
a-rabs
was
going
to
camp
in
cave
hollow
with
two
hundred
elephants
,
and
six
hundred
camels
,
and
over
a
thousand
“sumter”
mules
,
all
loaded
down
with
di’monds
,
and
they
didn’t
have
only
a
guard
of
four
hundred
soldiers
,
and
so
we
would
lay
in
ambuscade
,
as
he
called
it

kill
the

prettier

they
warn’t

me
all
about

it
was
reckoned
i
was
murdered
,
and
how
pap
disappeared
pretty
soon
,
and
didn’t
come
back
no
more
,

what
a
stir
there
was
when
jim
run
away
;
and
i
told
tom
all
about
our
royal
nonesuch
rapscallions
,
and
as
much
of
the
raft
voyage
as
i
had
time
to
;
and
as
we
struck
into
the
town
and
up
through
the
the
middle
of
it--it
was
as
much
as
half-after
eight
,
then—here
comes
a
raging
rush
of
people
with
torches
,
and
an
awful
whooping
and
yelling
,
and
banging
tin
pans
and
blowing
horns
;
and
we
jumped
to
one
side
to
let
them
go
by
;
and
as
they
went
by
i
see
they
had
the
king
and
the
duke
astraddle
of
a
rail—that
is
,
i
knowed
it
was
the
king
and
the
duke
,
though
they
was
all
over
tar
and
feathers
,
and
didn’t
look
like
nothing
in
the
world
that
was
human—just
looked
like
a
couple
of
monstrous
big
soldier-plumes

at

,
under
several
small
pine
trees
,
he
found
some
firewood
which
had
been
car-
ried
there
by
the
high
water
of
last

good
many
miles
wide
,
but
on
the
missouri
side
it
was
the
same
old
distance
across—a
half
a
mile—because
the
missouri
shore
was
just

i
set
by
my
camp
fire
smoking
,
and
feeling
pretty
well
satisfied
;
but
by
and
by
it
got
sort
of
lonesome
,
and
so
i
went
and
set
on
the
bank
and
listened
to
the
current
swashing
along
,
and
counted
the
stars
and
drift
logs
and
rafts
that
come
down
,
and
then
went
to
bed
;
there
ain’t
no
better
way
to
put
in
time
when
you
are
lonesome
;
you
can’t
stay
so
,
you
soon
get
over
it

beginning
to
come
on
dark
we
poked
our
heads
out
of
the
cottonwood
thicket
,
and
looked
up
and
down
and
across
;
nothing
in
sight
;
so
jim
took
up
some
of
the
top
planks
of
the
raft
and
built
a
snug
wigwam
to
get
under
in
blazing
weather
and
rainy
,

to
keep
the
things
dry

he
placed
the
globe
in
her
hands
,
she
fainted
,
her
eyes
rolled
back
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
out
the
cabin
window
,
he
saw
wolf
tracks
crossing
the
river
,
owls
hunting
from
the
trees
,
six
feet
of
snow
like
a
quilt
ready

came
home
each
autumn
night
,
exhausted
,
forearms
stained
with
blood
,
she
was
hours
into
sleep
.

finally
made
it
to
the
cabin
,
there
were
no
tracks
on
the
porch
,
no
sign
that
she
had
gone
out
.

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

picked
her
up
at
the
library
,
she
had
applied
for
a
library
card
and
borrowed
twenty
books
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

woke
,
she
would
be
beside
him
,
holding
his
hand
,
her
hair
damp
,
her
eyes
wild
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
opened
his
eyes
,
he
saw
linen
curtains
,
women
in
gowns
kneeling
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
flicked
lustre
into
his
shoes
he
stood
up
and
pulled
his
waistcoat
down
more
tightly
on
his
plump
body
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
satisfied
his
hunger
he
grew
more
lively
,
and
began
laughingly
telling
some
story
about
the
birshov
household
,
but
perceiving
that
it
was
tiresome
and
that
zinaida
fyodorovna
was
not
laughing
,
he
ceased
.

|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
recovered
his
breath
and
his
control
,
he
sat
and
thought
about
meeting
death
with
dignity
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
out
on
the
shed
he
put
his
head
in
again
,
and
cussed
me
for
putting
on
frills
and
trying
to
be
better
than
him
;
and
when
i
reckoned
he
was
gone
he
come
back
and
put
his
head
in
again
,
and
told
me
to
mind
about
that
school
,
because
he
was
going
to
lay
for
me
and
lick
me
if
i
didn’t
drop
that
.

ciphered
it
out
he
told
me
how
we
was
to
do
;
then
we
went
and
waited
around
the
spoon-basket
till
we
see
aunt
sally
coming
,
and
then
tom
went
to
counting
the
spoons
and
laying
them
out
to
one
side
,
and
i
slid
one
of
them
up
my

him

told
me
he
was
in

with
me
,
there

something
brutal
in

praised
up

said
it
was
the

went

about

which
was
to
play
the
main
principal

at

when

everybody’s
expectations
up
high
enough
,
he
rolled
up
the

,
and
the
next

the
king
come
a-prancing
out
on
all

naked
;
and
he

all
over

her

to
retreat

amid

nippers
would
sometimes
impatiently
rise
from
his
seat
,
and
stooping
over
his
table
,
spread
his
arms
wide
apart
,
seize
the
whole
desk
,
and
move
it
,
and
jerk
it
,
with
a
grim
,
grinding
motion
on
the

,
as
if
the
table
were
a
perverse
voluntary
agent
,
intent
on
thwarting
and
vexing
him
;
i
plainly
perceive
that
for
nippers
,
brandy
and
water
were
altogether
superfluous
.

him
a
month

by
locking
the

for
even
a

hours
-

woke
up
i

where
i
was
for
a
minute
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
to
camp
i
warn’t
feeling
very
brash
,
there
warn’t
much
sand
in
my
craw
;
but
i
says
,
this
ain’t
no
time
to
be
fooling
around
.

it
jim
was
setting
there
with
his
head
down
between
his
knees
,
asleep
,
with
his
right
arm
hanging
over
the
steering-oar
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
three
log
doorsteps
i
heard
them
unlocking
and
unbarring
and
unbolting
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
where
i
found
the
boy
i
see
i
couldn’t
cut
the
bullet
out
without
some
help
,
and
he
warn’t
in
no
condition
for
me
to
leave
to
go
and
get
help
;
and
he
got
a
little
worse
and
a
little
worse
,
and
after
a
long
time
he
went
out
of
his
head
,
and
wouldn’t
let
me
come
a-nigh
him
any
more
,
and
said
if
i
chalked
his
raft
he’d
kill
me
,
and
no
end
of
wild
foolishness
like
that
,
and
i
see
i
couldn’t
do
anything
at
all
with
him
;
so
i
says
,
i
got
to
have
help
somehow
;
and
the
minute
i
says
it
out
crawls
this
nigger
from
somewheres
and
says
he’ll
help
,
and
he
done
it
,
too
,
and
done
it
very
well
.

down

crept
along
down
the

bank
a
piece
,

found
the
two
bodies
laying
in
the
edge
of
the
water
,

tugged
at
them
till
i
got
them
ashore
;

in
the
morning
the
parlor
was
shut
up
,
and
the

was
gone
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
back
with
the
duke
we
hid
the
canoe
,
and
then
they
set
down
on
a
log
,
and
the
king
told
him
everything
,
just
like
the
young
fellow
had
said
it—every
last
word
of
it
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
by
myself
i
went
to
thinking
the
thing
over
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
and
see
it
was
gone
,
i
says
to
myself
,
‘they’ve
got
into
trouble
and
had
to
leave
;
and
they’ve
took
my
nigger
,
which
is
the
only
nigger
i’ve
got
in
the
world
,
and
now
i’m
in
a
strange
country
,
and
ain’t
got
no
property
no
more
,
nor
nothing
,
and
no
way
to
make
my
living
;’
so
i
set
down
and
cried
.

it
was
all
still
and
sunday-like
,
and
hot
and
sunshiny
;
the
hands
was
gone
to
the
fields
;
and
there
was
them
kind
of
faint
dronings
of
bugs
and
flies
in
the
air
that
makes
it
seem
so
lonesome
and
like
everybody’s
dead
and
gone
;
and
if
a
breeze
fans
along
and
quivers
the
leaves
it
makes
you
feel
mournful
,
because
you
feel
like
it’s
spirits
whispering—spirits
that’s
been
dead
ever
so
many
years—and
you
always
think
they’re
talking
about
you
.

a
little
ways
i
heard
the
dim
hum
of
a
spinning-wheel
wailing
along
up
and
sinking
along
down
again
;
and
then
i
knowed
for
certain
i

i

dead—for
that
is

people
,
whoever
they
be
,
an
ironical
smile
began
to
come
into
his
eyes
,
and
his
whole
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
light
mockery
in

when
he
forgot
that
he
had
promised
to
go
and
see
her
,
i
drove
to
znamensky
street
,
put
a

into

at

they
talked

voluptuary
.

he
rolled
balls
of
bread
and
drank
a
great
deal
of
red
wine
,
absorbed
in
thought
,
strange
to
say
,
i
used
to
feel
almost
certain
that
there
was
something
in
him
of
which
perhaps
he
had
a
vague
sense
,
though
in
the
bustle
and
vulgarity
of
his
daily
life
he
had
not
time
to
understand
and
appreciate
it
.

last
on
saturday
the
bell
rang
below
and
she
heard
the
familiar
voice
on
the
stairs
,
she
was
so
delighted
that
she
broke
into
sobs

handed
her
anything

on
coming
in
from
shopping
she
made
haste
to
show
him
with
pride
some
new
purchase
,
he
would
glance
at
it
and
say
coldly
that
the
more
unnecessary
objects
they
had
in
the
flat
,
the
less
airy
it
would
be

reached
manhood
and
all
ideas
became
known
to
you
,
you
could
not
have
failed
to
see
the
truth
;
you
knew
it
,
but
you
did
not
follow
it
;
you
were
afraid
of
it
,
and
to
deceive
your
conscience
you
began
loudly
assuring
yourself
that
it
was
not
you
but
woman
that
was
to
blame
,
that
she
was
as
degraded
as
your
attitude
to
her

tuck
down
her
head
and
grumble
a
little
over
the
victuals
,

there

zinaida
fyodorovna
sat
up
night
after
night
for
her
george
,
looking
immovably
at
a
book
of
which
she
never
turned
a
page
,
or
when
she
shuddered
and
turned
pale
at
polya's
crossing
the
room
,
i
suffered
with
her
,
and
the
idea
occurred
to
me
to
lance
this
festering
wound
as
quickly
as
possible
by
letting
her
know
what
was
said
here
at
supper
on
thursdays
;
but—how
was
it
to
be
done
?

came
in
,
i
rushed
to
open
the
door
for
her
,
and
with
peculiar
tenderness
took
off
her
fur
coat
.

we
got
into
the
cab
and
the
hood
was
put
up
,
trembling
all
over
,
she
began
hurriedly
saying
how
grateful
she
was
to
me
.
|

|
|
|

|
|
|

enough
!

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
there
there
warn’t
nobody
stirring
;
streets
empty
,
and
perfectly
dead
and
still
,
like
sunday
.

she
set
me
down
in
a
split-bottomed
chair
,
and
set
herself
down
on
a
little
low
stool
in
front
of
me
,
holding
both
of
my
hands
,
and
says
:
“now
i
can
have
a
good
look
at
you
;
and
,
laws-a-me
,
i’ve
been
hungry
for
it
a
many
and
a
many
a
time
,
all
these
long

we
took
a
look
at
the
front
and
the
two
sides
;
and
on
the
side
i
warn’t
acquainted
with—which
was
the
north
side—we
found
a
square
window-hole
,
up
tolerable
high
,
with
just
one
stout
board
nailed
across
it
.

it
was
so
dark
;

jim
was
there
,
sure
enough
,
and

he

out

in
the

we
always
drank

talked
.

was
passing
by
the

i

noise
.

ten
foot
off

ready
to
shove
off
we
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
island
,
and
it
was
pretty
broad
day
;
so
i
made
jim
lay
down
in
the
canoe
and
cover
up
with
the
quilt
,
because
if
he
set
up
people
could
tell
he
was
a

a

three

four
hundred
yards
down-stream
we
see
the
lantern
show
like
a
little
spark
at
the
texas
door
for
a
second
,
and
we
knowed
by
that
that
the
rascals
had
missed
their
boat
,
and
was
beginning
to
understand
that
they
was
in
just
as
much

out

looked
back

around
a
second
,

a-running
,
and
says
:
“mars

three-quarters
of
a
mile

we
hoisted
up
our
signal
lantern
;
and
about
ten
o’clock
it
come
on
to
rain
and
blow
and
thunder
and
lighten
like
everything
;
so
the
king
told
us
to
both
stay
on
watch
till
the
weather
got
better
;
then
him
and
the

crawled

her
eyes
rolled
back
in
her
head
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
water
on
them
turned
to
ice
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
every
day
he
brought
in
new
books
with
him
or
received
parcels
of
them
from
the
shops
,
and
there
were
heaps
of
books
in
three
languages
,
to
say
nothing
of
russian
,
which
he
had
read
and
thrown
away
,
in
the
corners
of
my
room
and
under
my
bed
.

|

finally
she
stood
.
|
|
pointed
the
truck
south
and
didn't
turn
back
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
after
dark
,
he
got
the
engine
turned
over
and
ramped
the
truck
up
onto
the
frozen
,
wind-crusted
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
when
he
could
endure
no
more
,
he
pulled
his
hands
apart
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
dropped
to
the
ground
,
unable
to
stop
his
fall
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
resolved
upon
this
;—i
would
put
certain
calm
questions
to
him
the
next
morning
,
touching
his
history
,
&c
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
left
it
.
|
|
|
pushed
them
into
the
sand
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
buried
him
here
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
"when
i
touched
her
,"
she
said
,
"i
saw
where
she
went
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
of
you
in
moscow
,
you
seemed
to
me
so
ideal
,
so
lofty
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
away
from
here
last
,
five
years
ago
,
you
were
still
a
child
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
did
you
lend
him
the
pound
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
one
has
been
a
long
while
on
one's
travels
and
reaches
a
hotel
at
last
,
it's
difficult
to
believe
that
one
hasn't
to
go
on
.

said
sternly

were
ill
i
heard
you
in
your
delirium
,
and
ever
since
these
adoring
eyes
,
these
sighs
,
and
edifying
conversations
about
friendship
,
about
spiritual
kinship

was
capricious
,
condescending
,
told
you
lies
,
i
marvelled
how
it
was
you
did
not
see
,
did
not
understand
,
when
it
was
all
so
clear

"winter

getting

he
said
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
winter
threw
itself
at
the
cabin
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lying
there
,
she
saw
all
their
dreams
at
once
,
the
winter
reveries
of
scores
of
worker
bees
,
each
one
fiercely
vivid
:
bright
trails
through
thorns
to
a
clutch
of
wild
roses
,
honey
tidily
brimming
a
hundred
combs
.

|
|
|
|
on
her
bed
she
breathed
into
her
pillow
and
dreamed
of
how
nice
it
would
be
to
go
and
buy
the
most
expensive
brooch
and
fling
it
into
the
face
of
this
bullying
woman
.

with
each
day
she
learned
more
about
what
she
could
do
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
of
them
the
same
thing
happened
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
love
still
lodged
in
his
heart
like
a
splinter
,
he
married
her
in
the
first
muds
of
spring
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
his
last
dregs
of
energy
he
constructed
a
fire
and
poured
a
mug
of
hot
water
down
her
throat
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
frozen
hands
he
could
neither
draw
nor
hold
his
76
to
build
a
fire
knife
.

over
his
eyes
to
protect
them
from
the
sun
,
he
looked
at
the
apparatus
in
the
hole
.

legs
apart
and
his
hands
on
his

,
the
officer
stood
still
and
looked
at
the
ground

folded
he
begged
and
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
stay
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
her
stomach
empty
and
her
body
quieted
,
without
the
daily
demands
of
living
,
she
felt
she
was
making
important
discoveries
.
|

|
|
|
|

|

a
steady
diet
of
meat
and
vegetables
her
body
bloomed
,
her
hair
shone
,
her
eyes
and
cheeks
glowed
.

little
trouble
we
made
out
to
examine
the
papers
without
bartleby
,
though
at
every
page
or
two
,
turkey
deferentially
dropped
his
opinion
that
this
proceeding
was
quite
out
of
the
common
;
while
nippers
,
twitching
in
his
chair
with
a
dyspeptic
nervousness
,
ground
out
between
his
set
teeth
occasional
hissing
maledictions
against
the
stubborn
oaf
behind
the
screen
.

sort
of
sleepy
persistence
he
kept
directing
his
gaze
to
the
place
where
the
officer
had
just
pointed
,
and
when
the
question
from
the
traveler
interrupted
the
officer
,
the
condemned
man
looked
at
the
traveler
,
too
,
just
as
the
officer
was
doing
.

him
walked
his

whom
he
wanted
to
take
to
school
:
it

on
the
way
.

all
that
,
the
inhabitants
did
nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
,
and
took
no
interest
in
anything
,
and
it
was
quite
impossible
to
think
of
anything
to
say

|
this
going
on
,
the
condemned
man
totally
forgot
the
traveler’s
order
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
air
of
a
victim
he
stretched
himself
in
his
easy-chair
in
the
study
,
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
took
up
a
book
.

passage
of

certain

have
been

parts

of
his
bayonet
the
soldier
pulled
out
the

were
lying
in

tears
glistening
on
her
eyelashes
,
sitting
on
orlov's
knee
,
she
told
him
in
a
low
voice
something
touching
,
something
like
a
reminiscence
of
childhood
and
youth
.

came
the

sleepiness
.

much
lifting
of

feet
,
it
cried
softly
.

,
sir
,
we
both
are
getting
old
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
some
apprehension
the
traveler
observed
that
the
officer
was
clenching
his
fists
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
frequent
upward
glances
he
reassures
himself
that
you
are
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
great
care
he
set
the
page
in
the
inscriber
and
appeared
to
rotate
the
gear
mechanism
completely
around
.

coiled
beneath

sealed
,
tongues
stilled
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
minutes
later
he
was
walking
along
the
road
to
the
station
,
and
was
glad
of
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

each
time
she
touched
a
frozen
insect
,
a
slumbering
amphibian
,
anything
just
dead
,
her
eyes
rolled
back
and
its
visions
,
its
heaven
,
went
shivering
through
her
body
.

he
dreamt
of

,
of
running
with

soaring
over

tearing
into
the

cattle
.

it

piercing
through

mist

with
another

who
was
two
years
older

there
the
sky
was
beginning
to
get
a
little
gray
in
the
east
;
so
we
struck
for
an
island
,
and
hid
the
raft
,
and
sunk
the
skiff
,
and
turned
in
and
slept

once
a
week
the
hunter
drove
to
town
to
collect
a
parcel
of
books
from
the
post
office
:
arcana
mundi
,
the
seer's
dictionary
,
paragon
of

|
|
|

in
two
or
three
months
she
left
s——
,
telling
her
husband
that
she
was
going
to
consult
a
doctor
about
an
internal
complaint—and
her
husband
believed
her
,
and
did
not
believe
her

a
while
the
thought
repeated
itself
that
it
was
very
cold
and
that
he
had
never
experienced
such
cold
.

he
was
going
to
see
her
in
this
way
on
a
winter
morning
(the
messenger
had
come
the
evening
before
when
he
was
out)
.

to
a
walk
,

the
thought
that
the
freezing
of

made
him
run
again

was
gone
three
days

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
or
twice
a
week
,
in
the
park
or
in
the
house
,
he
met
the
black
monk
and
had
long
conversations
with
him
,
but
this
did
not
alarm
him
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
delighted
him
,
as
he
was
now
firmly
persuaded
that
such
apparitions
only
visited
the
elect
few
who
rise
up
above
their
fellows
and
devote
themselves
to
the
service
of
the

of
a
night
we
would
see
a
steamboat
slipping
along
in
the
dark
,
and
now
and
then
she
would
belch
a
whole
world
of
sparks
up
out
of
her
chimbleys
,
and
they
would
rain
down
in
the
river
and
look
awful
pretty
;
then
she
would
turn
a
corner
and
her
lights
would
wink
out
and
her
powwow
shut
off
and
leave
the
river
still
again
;
and
by
and
by
her
waves
would
get
to
us
,
a
long
time
after
she
was
gone
,
and
joggle
the
raft
a
bit
,
and
after
that
you
wouldn’t
hear
nothing
for
you
couldn’t
tell
how
long
,
except
maybe
frogs
or
something
.

when
i
was
in
a
happy
,
dreamy
mood
,
i
asked
her
at
dinner
(we
had
soup
and
roast
meat
sent
in
from
a
restaurant
every
day)
:
"polya
,
do
you
believe
in
god
?

|
|
|
|
turned
short
and
dodged
under
his
arm
he
made
a
grab
and
got
me
by
the
jacket
between
my
shoulders
,
and
i
thought
i
was
gone
;
but
i
slid
out
of
the
jacket
quick
as
lightning
,
and
saved
myself
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
coming
around
a
bend
,
he
moved
suddenly
to
the
side
,
like
a
frightened
horse
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sensing
dan-
ger
,
he
made
the
dog
go
ahead
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
away
from
the
danger
,
he
continued
at
his
four-mile
pace
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
machine
is
set
in
this
position
,
this
steel
cable
tightens
up
into
a
rod
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
got
a
fish-line
,
but
no
hooks
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
to
myself
it
would
be
a
thousand
times
better
for
jim
to
be
a
slave
at
home
where
his
family
was
,
as
long
as
he’d
got
to
be
a
slave
,
and
so
i’d
better
write
a
letter
to
tom
sawyer
and
tell
him
to
tell
miss
watson
where
he
was
.

there
was
a
thick
fog
,
and
the
rafts
and
things
that
went
by
was
beating
tin
pans
so
the
steamboats
wouldn’t
run
over
them
.

him
in

few
hours
he
was
home
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

could
she
ask
him
to
understand
such
a
thing
?
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
anyone
understand
?
|
|
|
they
be
free
from
this
intolerable
bondage

they
get
them
?

|
|
dat
come
?
|
|
|
|
cool
it
must
be
outside
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
pleasant
it
would
be
to
walk
out
alone
,
first
along
by
the
river
and
then
through
the
park
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
much
more
pleasant
it
would
be
there
than
at
the
supper-table
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
do
a
king
git
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
?
|
tactless
!
|
|
stupid
!
|
|
barbarous
!
|
|
out
of
place
it
was
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
wickedly
mother
nature
jested
at
man's
expense
,
after
all
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
humiliating
it
was
to
recognise
it
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
are
things
?
|
|
|
can
they
waste
whole
days
doing
nothing
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
get
loose
when
there’s
a
guard
over
them
,
ready
to
shoot
them
down
if
they
move
a
peg
?

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
?
|
|
anyone
take
this
felt
into
his
mouth
without
feeling
disgusted—something
that
a
hundred
man
have
sucked
and
bitten
on
it
as
they
were
dying
?

me
of
his
father
!
|

she
loved
him
!
|
|
|
|
was
it
that
a
man
who
had
thought
and
read
so
much
could
not
imagine
anything
more
sensible
?

grateful
i
should
be

you

early
your
soul
has
taken
to
its
dressing-gown
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
soft
,
how
snug
,
how
warm
,
how
comfortable—and
how
bored
you
are
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
should
we
meet
?
|
|
|
|
delightful
it
was
!
|
|
|
|
unlike
it
was
to
that
petersburg
night
when
the
wet
snow
was
falling
and
beating
so
rudely
on
our
faces
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
would
prove
in
practice—there
was
the
rub
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
all
took
in
the
expression
of
transfiguration
on
the
martyred
face
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
held
our
cheeks
in
the
glow
of
this
justice
,
finally
attained
and
already
passing
away
!

more
clearly
than

she
could
see
that
there
was
a
fine
line

dreams

wakefulness

dying

a
line

tenuous
it

jumped

personal
life
rested
on
secrecy
,
and
possibly
it
was
partly
on
that

that

man

into

was
silence
around
;
the
stars
looked
down
from
the
sky
in
the
profound
stillness
,
and
startsev's
footsteps
sounded
loud
and
out
of
place
,
and
only
when
the
church
clock
began
striking
and
he
imagined
himself
dead
,
buried
there
for
ever
,
he
felt
as
though
some
one
were
looking
at
him
,
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
it
was
not
peace
and
tranquillity
,
but
stifled
despair
,
the
dumb
dreariness
of
non-existence
.

he
sassed

said
he’d

lay
them
out
in

he
couldn’t

now

he’d
come

set
at

with
susan

,
and
said
how
bad
the
biscuits
was
,

how
mean
the
preserves
was
,
and
how
ornery
and
tough
the
fried
chickens
was—and
all
that

rot
,
the
way

always
do
for

out
compliments

the

spread

out

though
their
life
was
modest
,
they
believed
in
eating
well
;
the
best
of
everything
:
diamond-bone
sirloins
,
three-shilling
tea
and
the
best
bottled
stout
.

she
was
stout
in
build

stood
erect

her
slow

her
the

did
not

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
to
be
sure
,
when
i
reflected
upon
it
,
it
was
not
strange
that
people
entering
my
office
should
be
struck
by
the
peculiar
aspect
of
the
unaccountable
bartleby
,

so
be
tempted

throw
out
some
sinister
observations
concerning
him

,
they
had
good
reason
to
be
fussy
on
such
a
night
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
is
very
nice
and
useful
,

sometimes
one
longs
for
something
else
for
variety
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

to
be
a
script
that
isn’t
simple
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it's
not
a
lap-dog
,
but
a
human
being
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
from
behind
the
screen
the
usual
answer
,
“i
prefer
not

was
sure
to
come
;
and
then
,
how
could
a
human
creature
with
the
common
infirmities
of
our
nature
,
refrain
from
bitterly
exclaiming
upon
such
perverseness—such
unreasonableness

i
was
where
the
current
set
in
the
closest
to
the
shore—i
knowed
enough
for
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

wanted
to
slide
down

get
it
out

there

i
dasn’t
try
it

he
must
be

there
i
was
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
was
a
booming
current
;
and
of
course
that
boat
started
her
engines
again
ten
seconds
after
she
stopped
them
,
for
they
never
cared
much
for
raftsmen
;
so
now
she
was
churning
along
up
the
river
,
out
of
sight
in
the
thick
weather
,
though
i
could
hear
her

a
cold
morning
when
business
was

dull
,
turkey
would
gobble
up
scores
of
these
cakes
,
as
if
they
were
mere
wafers—indeed
they
sell
them
at
the
rate
of
six
or
eight
for
a
penny—the
scrape
of
his
pen
blending
with
the
crunching
of
the
crisp
particles
in
his
mouth
.

sunday
,
wall-street
is
deserted
as
petra
;
and
every
night
of
every
day
it
is
an
emptiness
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
all
the
fiery
afternoon
blunders
and
flurried
rashnesses
of
turkey
,
was
his
once
moistening
a
ginger-cake
between
his
lips
,
and
clapping
it
on
to
a
mortgage
for
a
seal
.

besides
they
were
dreadfully
afraid
that
freddy
malins
might
turn
up
screwed
.

i

it's
bedtime

if
there
is
not
a
living
soul
at
hand
who
dares
to
tell
you
the
truth
without
flattery
,
let
your
flunkey
stepan
wash
your
magnificent
countenance

you

what
did
it
matter
?
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
sunday
;
and
there
was
something
about
bartleby
that
forbade
the
supposition
that
we
would
by
any
secular
occupation
violate
the
proprieties
of
the
day
.

still
works
and

on
its
own

|
|
|
|

you
know
,
you’ll
be
in
costume
,
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
;
juliet’s
in
a
balcony
,
enjoying
the
moonlight
before
she
goes
to
bed
,
and
she’s
got
on
her
night-gown
and
her
ruffled
nightcap

freddy
malins
always
came
late
,
but
they
wondered
what
could
be
keeping
gabriel
:
and
that
was
what
brought
them
every
two
minutes
to
the
banisters
to
ask
lily
had
gabriel
or
freddy
come
.

bade
the
misses
morkan
good-evening
in
what
seemed
an
offhand
fashion
by
reason
of
the
habitual
catch
in
his
voice
and
then
,
seeing
that
mr

|
|
|
|

,
who
had
listened
with
his
head
perched
sideways
to
hear
her
better
,
was
still
applauding
when
everyone
else
had
ceased
and
talking
animatedly
to
his
mother
who
nodded
her
head
gravely
and
slowly
in
acquiescence
.

with
his
hat
well
back
on
his
head
and
his
shoulders
humped
with
cold
,
was
puffing
and
steaming
after
his
exertions
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

said
there
was
a
negro
chieftain
singing
in
the
second
part
of
the
gaiety
pantomime
who
had
one
of
the
finest
tenor
voices
he
had
ever
heard
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
also
took
a
stalk
of
celery
and
ate
it
with
his
pudding
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
explained
to
him
,
as
best
he
could
,
that
the
monks
were
trying
to
make
up
for
the
sins
committed
by
all
the
sinners
in
the
outside
world

beat
time
with
his
pudding-fork
and
the
singers
turned
towards
one
another
,
as
if
in
melodious
conference
,
while
they
sang
with
emphasis
:
unless
he
tells
a
lie
,
unless
he
tells
a
lie
,
then
,
turning
once
more
towards
their
hostesses
,
they
sang
:
for
they
are
jolly
gay
fellows
,
for
they
are
jolly
gay
fellows
,
for
they
are
jolly
gay
fellows
,
which
nobody
can

her
on

only

up

it
into

exclaimed

said
lily
to
gabriel
when
she
opened
the
door
for
him
,
"miss

,
"that

you

he
told

he

dreadful
cold

couldn't
sing

frankly

leaned
over
the

listen
for
the
hall-door

called
out

him
to
sing
later
on

sit
down

he
thought
,

he
sat
down
in
an
arm-chair

you

horrid

gabriel
smiled
at
the
three
syllables
she
had
given
his
surname
and
glanced
at
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
known
her
when
she
was
a
child
and
used
to
sit
on
the
lowest
step
nursing
a
rag
doll
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
gone
to
the
door
with
the
others
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
says
everyone
wears
them
on
the
continent
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knitted
his
brows
and
said
,
as
if
he
were
slightly
angered
:
"it's
nothing
very
wonderful
,
but
gretta
thinks
it
very
funny
because
she
says
the
word
reminds
her
of
christy
minstrels
.

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
could
not
listen
while
mary
jane
was
playing
her
academy
piece
,
full
of
runs
and
difficult
passages
,
to
the
hushed
drawing-room
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
found
himself
partnered
with
miss
ivors
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
coloured
and
was
about
to
knit
his
brows
,
as
if
he
did
not
understand
,
when
she
said
bluntly
:
"o
,
innocent
amy
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
glanced
right
and
left
nervously
and
tried
to
keep
his
good
humour
under
the
ordeal
which
was
making
a
blush
invade
his
forehead
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
did
not
answer
for
his
retort
had
heated
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
asked
her
whether
she
had
had
a
good
crossing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
himself
was
he
the
cause
of
her
abrupt
departure
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hardly
heard
what
she
said
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
recognised
the
prelude
.
|
|
|
|
applauded
loudly
with
all
the
others
at
the
close
of
the
song
and
loud
applause
was
borne
in
from
the
invisible
supper-table
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
his
seat
boldly
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
,
having
looked
to
the
edge
of
the
carver
,
plunged
his
fork
firmly
into
the
goose
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
began
to
carve
second
helpings
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
the
first
round
without
serving
himself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
having
finished
,
the
huge
pudding
was
transferred
to
the
table
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
leaned
his
ten
trembling
fingers
on
the
tablecloth
and
smiled
nervously
at
the
company
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
on
more
boldly
:
"i
feel
more
strongly
with
every
recurring
year
that
our
country
has
no
tradition
which
does
it
so
much
honour
and
which
it
should
guard
so
jealously
as
that
of
its
hospitality

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
advanced
from
the
little
pantry
behind
the
office
,
struggling
into
his
overcoat
and
,
looking
round
the
hall
,
said
:
"gretta
not
down
yet
?

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
surprised
at
her
stillness
and
strained
his
ear
to
listen
also
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
held
up
his
hand
for
them
to
be
silent
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
her
hand
for
a
moment
longer
,
irresolutely
,
and
then
,
shy
of
intruding
on
her
grief
,
let
it
fall
gently
and
walked
quietly
to
the
window
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
watched
his
wife
,
who
did
not
join
in
the
conversation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
pointed
to
the
statue
,
on
which
lay
patches
of
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
shot
the
lock
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
threw
his
overcoat
and
hat
on
a
couch
and
crossed
the
room
towards
the
window
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
paused
for
a
few
moments
,
watching
her
,
and
then
said
:
"gretta
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
waited
again
and
then
,
fearing
that
diffidence
was
about
to
conquer
him
,
he
said
abruptly
:
"by
the
way
,
gretta
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
strove
to
restrain
himself
from
breaking
out
into
brutal
language
about
the
sottish
malins
and
his
pound
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
trembling
with
delight
at
her
sudden
kiss
and
at
the
quaintness
of
her
phrase
,
put
his
hands
on
her
hair
and
began
smoothing
it
back

feeling
now
how
vain
it
would
be
to
try
to
lead
her
whither
he
had
purposed
,
caressed
one
of
her
hands
and
said
,
also
sadly
:

looked
for

followed

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
felt
humiliated
by
the
failure
of
his
irony
and
by
the
evocation
of
this
figure

the
dead
,
a

in

of

the

drew

fiercely
on

said
:

i

sally
was
a
good

uneasy
;
but
uncle
silas
he
said
there
warn’t
no
occasion
to
be—boys

said
,

you’ll
see
this
one
turn
up

all

all

every

uncle

mooning
around
i
dodged
him

that
was
uncle

jumped
for
her
,
and
most
hugged
the
head
off
of
her
,
and
cried
over
her
,
and
i
found
a
good
enough
place
for
me
under
the
bed
,
for
it
was
getting
pretty
sultry

we

no
trouble
about
snags
;
the
lightning
was
glaring
and
flittering
around
so
constant
that
we
could
see
them
plenty
soon
enough
to
throw
her

him
all
over

him
out

cook
none
of
the
pies
in
the
wash-pan—afraid
the
solder
would
melt
;
but
uncle
silas
he
had
a
noble
brass
warming-pan
which
he
thought
considerable
of
,
because
it
belonged
to
one
of
his
ancesters
with
a
long
wooden
handle
that
come
over
from
england
with
william
the
conqueror
in
the
mayflower
or
one
of
them
early
ships
and
was
hid
away
up
garret
with
a
lot
of
other
old
pots
and
things
that
was
valuable
,
not
on
account
of
being
any
account
,
because
they
warn’t
,
but
on
account
of
them
being
relicts
,
you
know
,
and
we
snaked
her
out
,
private
,
and
took
her
down
there
,
but
she
failed
on
the
first
pies
,
because
we
didn’t
know
how
,
but
she
come
up
smiling
on
the
last
one

monstrous

on
it

a
roll
of
buckskin
,

some

just
as

i

there
in
about
a
half
an
hour
fairly
dripping
,
for
it
was
a
most
awful
hot
day
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

to

three
days
.

have
a
rock
for
the
coat
of
arms
and
mournful
inscriptions

rock

her
half
way
;
and
then
we
was
plumb
played
out
,
and
most
drownded
with
sweat
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
splendid
stock
of
sorted
spiders
,
and
bugs
,
and
frogs
,
and
caterpillars
,
and
one
thing
or
another
;
and
we
like
to
got
a
hornet’s
nest
,
but
we
didn’t
.

licking
every
time
one
of
our
snakes
come
in
her
way
,
and
she
allowed
these
lickings
warn’t
nothing
to
what
she
would
do
if
we
ever
loaded
up
the
place
again
with
them
.

went
tiptoeing
along
a
path
amongst
the
trees
back
towards
the
end
of
the
widow’s
garden
,
stooping
down
so
as
the
branches
wouldn’t
scrape
our
heads
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
down
the
hill
and
found
jo
harper
and
ben
rogers
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
boys
,
hid
in
the
old
tanyard
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
a
clump
of
bushes
,
and
tom
made
everybody
swear
to
keep
the
secret
,
and
then
showed
them
a
hole
in
the
hill
,
right
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
bushes
.

about
two
hundred
yards
,
and
then
the
cave
opened
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
along
a
narrow
place
and
got
into
a
kind
of
room
,
all
damp
and
sweaty
and
cold
,
and
there
we
stopped
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
out
with
the
skiff
and
towed
it
ashore
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
winding
in
and
out
amongst
the
trees
,
and
sometimes
the
vines
hung
so
thick
we
had
to
back
away
and
go
some
other
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sneaking
down
the
slope
of
it
to
labboard
,
in
the
dark
,
towards
the
texas
,
feeling
our
way
slow
with
our
feet
,
and
spreading
our
hands
out
to
fend
off
the
guys
,
for
it
was
so
dark
we
couldn’t
see
no
sign
of
them
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gliding
swift
along
,
dead
silent
,
past
the
tip
of
the
paddle-box
,
and
past
the
stern
;
then
in
a
second
or
two
more
we
was
a
hundred
yards
below
the
wreck
,
and
the
darkness
soaked
her
up
,
every
last
sign
of
her
,
and
we
was
safe
,
and
knowed
it
.

drifting
down
into
a
big
bend
,
and
the
night
clouded
up
and
got
hot
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
through
the
yard
so
as

what
the
hounds
would
do
.

|

scrouched
down

laid
still

stop
stages
and
carriages
on
the
road
,
with
masks
on
,

kill

money
.

nobody

killed
any

only
just

.

ever
been
this
rich
before
in
neither
of
our
lives
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
busted
it
up
,
and
chased
the
children
up
the
hollow
;
but
we
never
got
anything
but
some
doughnuts
and
jam
,
though
ben
rogers
got
a
rag
doll
,
and
jo
harper
got
a
hymn-book
and
a
tract
;
and
then
the
teacher
charged
in
,
and
made
us
drop
everything
and
cut
.

always
locked

nights

tramped
and
clumb
around
all
over
it
,
and
by
and
by
found
a
good
big
cavern
in
the
rock
,
most
up
to
the
top
on
the
side
towards
illinois
.

took
some
fish
off

lines

set
them
again
,

begun

get

for
dinner
.

and
lined
her
with
dough
,
and
set
her
in
the
coals
,
and
loaded
her
up
with
rag
rope
,
and
put
on
a
dough
roof
,
and
shut
down
the
lid
,
and
put
hot
embers
on
top
,
and
stood
off
five
foot
,
with
the
long
handle
,
cool
and
comfortable
,
and
in
fifteen
minutes
she
turned
out
a
pie
that
was
a
satisfaction
to
look
at
.

him

just
set
there
and
watched
him
rip

around

he
drownded
.

found
a

in

everybody

gone

it
;
a
little
bit
of
a
concern
,
up
over
a
carpenter
shop—carpenters
and
printers
all
gone
to
the
meeting
,

no

the

open

there

in
it

was
in

much

so
many
things

the
path
to
the
mill
;
and
when
they
got
pretty
close
on
to
us
we
dodged
into
the
bush
and
let
them
go
by
,
and
then
dropped
in
behind
them
.

out
of
coffee

jim

i

go
along

some
.

very
well
satisfied
with
this
business
,
and
tom
allowed
it
was
worth
twice
the
trouble
it
took
,
because
he
said
now
she
couldn’t
ever
count
them
spoons
twice
alike
again
to
save
her
life
;
and
wouldn’t
believe
she’d
counted
them
right
if
she
did
;
and
said
that
after
she’d
about
counted
her
head
off
for
the
next
three
days
he
judged
she’d
give
it
up
and
offer
to
kill
anybody
that
wanted
her
to
ever
count
them
any
more
.

feeling
pretty
good
after
breakfast
,
and
took
my
canoe
and
went
over
the
river
a-fishing
,
with
a
lunch
,
and
had
a
good
time
,
and
took
a
look
at
the
raft
and
found
her
all
right
,
and
got
home
late
to
supper
,
and
found
them
in
such
a
sweat
and
worry
they
didn’t
know
which
end
they
was
standing
on
,
and
made
us
go
right
off
to
bed
the
minute
we
was
done
supper
,
and
wouldn’t
tell
us
what
the
trouble
was
,
and
never
let
on
a
word
about
the
new
letter
,
but
didn’t
need
to
,
because
we
knowed
as
much
about
it
as
anybody
did
,
and
as
soon
as
we
was
half
up
stairs
and
her
back
was
turned
we
slid
for
the
cellar
cupboard
and
loaded
up
a
good
lunch
and
took
it
up
to
our
room
and
went
to
bed
,
and
got
up
about
half-past
eleven
,
and
tom
put
on
aunt
sally’s
dress
that
he
stole
and
was
going
to
start
with
the
lunch
,
but
says
:
“where’s
the
butter
?

laid
there
all
day
,

watched
the
rafts

steamboats
spin
down
the
missouri
shore
,

up-bound
steamboats
fight
the

river

off
all
the
afternoon
in
the
woods
talking
,

me
reading
the
books
,

having
a
general
good
time
.

|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

up
for
the
day
on
a
towhead
tolerable
close
to
the
left-hand
bank
.

low
and
kept
still
,
and
never
shoved
out
till
nearly
ten
o’clock
;
then
we
slid
by
,
pretty
wide
away
from
the
town
,
and
didn’t
hoist
our
lantern
till
we
was
clear
out
of
sight
of
it
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
out
to
do
it
,
and
we
done
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
made
an
extra
steering-oar
,
too
,
because
one
of
the
others
might
get
broke
on
a
snag
or
something
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fixed
up
a
short
forked
stick
to
hang
the
old
lantern
on
,
because
we
must
always
light
the
lantern
whenever
we
see
a
steamboat
coming
down-stream
,
to
keep
from
getting
run
over
;
but
we
wouldn’t
have
to
light
it
for
up-stream
boats
unless
we
see
we
was
in
what
they
call
a
“crossing”
;
for
the
river
was
pretty
high
yet
,
very
low
banks
being
still
a
little
under
water
;
so
up-bound
boats
didn’t
always
run
the
channel
,
but
hunted
easy
water
.

it
up
away
down
in
the
woods
,
and
cooked
it
there
;
and
we
got
it
done
at
last
,
and
very
satisfactory
,
too
;
but
not
all
in
one
day
;
and
we
had
to
use
up
three
wash-pans
full
of
flour
before
we
got
through
,
and
we
got
burnt
pretty
much
all
over
,
in
places
,
and
eyes
put
out
with
the
smoke
;
because
,
you
see
,
we
didn’t
want
nothing
but
a
crust
,
and
we
couldn’t
prop
it
up
right
,
and
she
would
always
cave
in
.

catched

warn’t

,

it
was
all
comfortable
now
.

going

borrow
it
when
there
warn’t

around

only
tom
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
shot
a
water-fowl
now
and
then
that
got
up
too
early
in
the
morning
or
didn’t
go
to
bed
early
enough
in

evening
.

in

let
the

take
care

itself
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
struck
for
the
stern
of
the
texas
,

found
it
,
and
then
scrabbled
along
forwards
on
the
skylight
,
hanging
on
from
shutter

shutter
,
for
the

it
mighty
lucky
;
there
was
going
to
be
a
circus
there
that
afternoon
,
and
the
country
people
was
already
beginning
to
come
in
,
in
all
kinds
of
old
shackly
wagons
,
and
on
horses
.

the
raft
at
the
same
time
,
and
in
less
than
two
seconds
we
was
gliding
down
stream
,
all
dark
and
still
,
and
edging
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
,
nobody
saying

boomed
along
down
the

watching

watching
for
our
raft
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
seen
a
light
now
away
down
to
the
right
,
on
shore
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hustled
it
on
to
the
raft
in
a
pile
,
and
i
told
jim
to
float
along
down
,
and
show
a
light
when
he
judged
he
had
gone
about
two
mile
,
and
keep
it
burning
till
i
come
;
then
i
manned
my
oars
and
shoved
for
the
light
.

|
|

judged
that
three
nights
more
would
fetch
us
to
cairo
,
at
the
bottom
of
illinois
,
where
the
ohio
river
comes
in
,
and
that
was
what
we
was
after
.

we
could
make
miles
enough
that
night
to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
the
powwow
we
reckoned
the
duke’s
work
in
the
printing
office
was
going
to
make
in
that
little
town
;
then
we
could
boom
right
along
if
we
wanted
to
.

they
was
studying
up
some
kind
of
worse
deviltry
than
ever
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
slept
most
all
day
,
and
started
out
at
night
,
a
little
ways
behind
a
monstrous
long
raft
that
was
as
long
going
by
as
a
procession
.

|
|
neither
of
us
could
keep
still
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
passed
another
town
before
daylight
,
and
i
was
going
out
again
;
but
it
was
high
ground
,
so
i
didn’t
go
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
lit
the
lantern
,
and
judged
she
would
see
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can
just
have
booming
times—they
don’t
have
no
school
now
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
spare
it
.
|
|
|
get
you
some
garter-snakes
,
and
you
can
tie
some
buttons
on
their
tails
,
and
let
on
they’re
rattlesnakes
,
and
i
reckon
that
‘ll
have
to
do
.

about
ten
mile
below
the
village

him

then
we

him
over

down

come
to
a
little
flat
piece
of
land
which
was
dry
and
very
thick
with
trees
and
bushes
and
vines
,
and
he
says
:
“you

the
little

lights
by

by—that
was
the
town
,
you

slid
by
,
about

a

out

,
after
all
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
heard
them
come
along
towards
the
crick
,
but
couldn’t
see
them
;
they
seemed
to
stop
and
fool
around
a
while
;
then
,
as
we
got
further
and
further
away
all
the
time
,
we
couldn’t
hardly
hear
them
at
all
;
by
the
time
we
had
left
a
mile
of
woods
behind
us
and
struck
the
river
,
everything
was
quiet
,
and
we
paddled
over
to
the
towhead
and
hid
in
the
cottonwoods
and
was
safe
.

he

said

that
would
do
him
more
good

it
over

over

at

we
made
up
our
minds
they
was
going
to
break
into
somebody’s
house

store
,

was
going

blowed
out
a
cylinder-head
.
|
|
|
|
|
asked
some
stragglers
about
it
,
and
they
said
everybody
went
to
the
show
looking
very
innocent
;
and
laid
low
and
kept
dark
till
the
poor
old
king
was
in
the
middle
of
his
cavortings
on
the
stage
;
then
somebody
give
a
signal
,
and
the
house
rose
up

stopped
talking
,
and
got
to
thinking
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fetched
an
armful
and
hid
it
in
the
weeds
,
and
set
down
to
rest
,
and
tom
says
,
kind
of
dissatisfied
:
“blame
it
,
this
whole
thing
is
just
as
easy

it

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
cleared
everything
out
of
the
way
,
about
four
or
five
foot
along
the
middle
of
the
bottom
log
.
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
stuck
to
it
about
a
half
an
hour
,
which
was
as
long
as
we
could
stand
up
;
but
we
had
a
good
deal
of
a
hole
to
show
for
it
.

crept
in
under
jim’s
bed
and
into
the
cabin
,
and
pawed
around
and
found
the
candle
and
lit
it
,
and
stood
over
jim
awhile
,
and
found
him
looking
hearty
and
healthy
,
and
then
we
woke
him
up
gentle
and
gradual
.

it
took
nine
months
to
make
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
smouched
the
grindstone
,
and
set
out
to
roll
her
home
,
but
it
was
a
most
nation
tough
job
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
it
warn’t
no
use
;
we
got
to
go
and
fetch
jim
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
reckoned
we
was
all
going
to
die
,
but
didn’t
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
followed
the
men
and
the
dogs
,
but
they
outrun
us
,
and
we
lost
them
;
but
we
thought
we
heard
them
on
the
water
,
so
we
got
a
canoe
and
took
out
after
them
and
crossed
over
,
but
couldn’t
find
nothing
of
them
;
so
we
cruised
along
up-shore
till
we
got
kind
of
tired
and
beat
out
;
and
tied
up
the
canoe
and
went
to
sleep
,
and
never
waked
up
till
about
an
hour
ago
;
then
we
paddled
over
here
to
hear
the
news
,
and
sid’s
at
the
post-office
to
see
what
he
can
hear
,
and
i’m
a-branching
out
to
get
something
to
eat
for
us
,
and
then
we’re
going
home
.

his
lips
until
his

bristled

appreciative

called
freddy

attention

disarray

filled
out

handed
him
a
full
glass

face
was
once
more
wrinkling
with
mirth
,
poured
out
for
himself
a
glass
of
whisky
while
freddy
malins
exploded
,
before
he
had
well
reached
the
climax
of
his
story
,
in
a
kink
of
high-pitched
bronchitic
laughter
and
,
setting
down
his
untasted
and
overflowing
glass
,
began
to
rub
the
knuckles
of
his
left
fist
backwards
and
forwards
into
his
left
eye
,
repeating
words
of
his
last
phrase

well
as
his
fit
of
laughter
would
allow
him

was
grinning
at
him
from
the
sideboard
,
crossed
the
room
on
rather
shaky
legs

began
to
repeat
in
an
undertone
the

told

from

leaned
upon

smiling
and
hanging
her
head
.

her

warning
to
and
fro

nodded
in
answer
and
,
when
she
had
gone
,
said
to
freddy

:
"now

his

said
to
those
who
were
near
him
in
the
manner
of
a
showman
introducing
a
prodigy
to
an
audience
:

them
to
sit
down
and
eat
their
suppers

so
did
gabriel

they
said
there
was
time
enough
,
so
that
,
at
last
,
freddy
malins
stood
up
and
,
capturing
aunt
kate
,
plumped
her
down
on
her
chair

she
began
immediately
,
in
great
haste

stating
the
causes

illness

trivial

his

you
in

off
the

now
,
when
he’d
take
off
his
new
white
beaver

make
a
bow

do
a

he
looked
that
grand

good

pious
that
you’d

he
had
walked
right

and
maybe
was

that
in

more
closely

he

under
cover
of
her
silence
he
pressed
her
arm
closely
to
his
side
;
and
,
as
they
stood
at
the
hotel
door
,
he
felt
that
they
had
escaped
from
their
lives
and
duties
,
escaped
from
home
and
friends
and
run
away
together
with
wild
and
radiant
hearts
to
a
new
adventure

made
myself
go
up

be

get
out
her
poor

it
didn’t
seem
right
that
there
warn’t
nobody
to
make
some
about
her
now
she
was
gone
;
so
i
tried

sweat
out

sitting

,
walking
on
the

,
a
fair-haired
young
lady
of

height
,
wearing
a
béret

a

beside
a
young
woman
who
in
the
dawn
seemed
so
lovely
,
soothed
and
spellbound
in
these
magical
surroundings—the
sea
,
mountains
,
clouds
,
the
open
sky—gurov
thought
how
in
reality
everything
is
beautiful
in
this
world
when
one
reflects
:
everything
except
what
we
think
or
do
ourselves
when
we
forget
our
human
dignity
and
the
higher
aims
of
our
existence

he
heard
the

laugh—visitors
were
arriving

experience
often
repeated

truly
bitter
experience
,
had
taught
him
long
ago
that
with
decent
people
,
especially
moscow
people—always
slow
to
move
and
irresolute—every
intimacy
,
which
at
first
so
agreeably
diversifies
life
and
appears
a
light
and
charming
adventure
,
inevitably
grows
into
a
regular
problem
of
extreme
intricacy
,
and
in

long
run
the
situation

lunched
with
one
of
these
people
,
the
man
was
a
peaceable
,
friendly
,

intelligent
human
being
;
that
as
soon
as
one
talked
of
anything
not
eatable
,
for
instance
,
of
politics

science
,
he
would
be
completely
at

loss
,

would
expound
a
philosophy
so
stupid

ill-natured
that
there
was
nothing

do

wave
one's
hand
in
despair
and
go
away

came
from

,
that
he
had
taken
his
degree

had
a
post
in

bank
;
that
he
had
trained
as

up

that

he

in

frosty
day
,
and
when
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
warm
gloves
,
and
walked
along
petrovka
,
and
when
on
saturday
evening
he
heard
the
ringing
of
the
bells
,
his
recent
trip
and
the
places
he
had
seen
lost

on

point

calling
to

his

began
beating
violently
,

in

excitement
he
could
not

,
who
was
sitting
in
the
stalls
,
too
,
went
up
to
her

said
in
a
trembling
voice
,
with
a
forced
smile
:
"good-evening

he

knew
of
it

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
afterwards
he
thought
about
her
in
his
room
at
the
hotel—thought
she
would
certainly
meet
him
next
day

it
would
be
sure
to
happen

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
remembering
sometimes
how
he
had
wandered
about
the
cemetery
or
how
he
had
driven
all
over
the
town
to
get
a
dress
suit
,
he
stretched
lazily
and
said
:
"what
a

of

when
the

were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
square
,
and
,
with
their
hands
behind
them
,
discussing
the
question
of
billets
,
all
the
ladies
were
gathered
together
at
the
examining
magistrate's
and
vying
with
one
another
in

go

there
was
a
great

of
work
in

he
was

so
my

were
quiet

peaceful
,
but
still
the
unclean
and

element
which
i
so
dreaded
on

was
conspicuous

itself

every

anna
sergeyevna
looked
through
her
lorgnette
at
the
steamer
and
the
passengers
as
though
looking
for
acquaintances
,
and
when
she
turned
to
gurov
her
eyes
were
shining
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|

was
silent
now
,

sniffed
the
flowers
without
looking
at
gurov
.

touching
;
there
was
about
her
the
purity
of
a
good
,
simple
woman
who
had
seen
little
of
life
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

made

to
go
.
|
|
|
|
|
did
not
visit
him
in
dreams
,
but
followed
him
about
everywhere
like
a
shadow
and
haunted
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

,
too
,
came
in
.
|
|
|
|
|
wearing
his
favourite
grey
dress
,
exhausted
by
the
journey
and
the
suspense
,
had
been
expecting
him
since
the
evening
before
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
grew
more
and
more
attached
to
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
he
loved
each
other
like
people
very
close
and
akin
,
like
husband
and
wife
,
like
tender
friends
;
it
seemed
to
them
that
fate
itself
had
meant
them
for
one
another
,
and
they
could
not
understand
why
he
had
a
wife
and
she
a
husband
;
and
it
was
as
though
they
were
a
pair
of
birds
of
passage
,
caught
and
forced
to
live
in
different
cages

flirting

thought
it
unseemly

more
to

said
to
servants
;
if
when
waiting
at
dinner
i
had
laughed
or
put
in
my
word
in

conversation
,
they
would
certainly
have

drooped
over

there

that

just
in

grew

did
that

these

in

he
looked
round
in
dread
of
some
one's
seeing
them

the
heat
,
the

sea

the
continual
passing
to

him

well-fed

they
drove
somewhere
out

to

to
the

the

here
he
was
;
he
had
had
the
accident
;
he
was
alone
;
and
he
had
saved
himself

the

then
came
the
sixth
hour
.

|

|
|
,
the
old
thing
commenced
again
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
said
,
why
couldn’t
she
tell
her
husband
to
fetch
a
dog
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
that’s
all
right
.

|
|

says
i
,
what’s
the
use
you
learning
to
do
right
when
it’s
troublesome
to
do
right
and
ain’t
no
trouble
to
do
wrong
,
and
the
wages
is
just
the
same
?

what
kind
o’
brothers
would
it
be
that
‘d
stand
in
his

at
sech
a
time
?

|

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
won’t
blow
on
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
happened
to
think
how
they
always
put
quicksilver
in
loaves
of
bread
and
float
them
off
,
because
they
always
go
right
to
the
drownded
carcass
and
stop
there
.

thatcher
he
took
it
and
put
it
out
at
interest
,
and
it
fetched
us
a
dollar
a
day
apiece
all
the
year
round—more
than
a
body
could
tell
what
to
do
with
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
couldn’t
see
no
advantage
in
going
where
she
was
going
,
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
wouldn’t
try
for
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stay
up
there
forever
;
so
at
last
i
got
down
,
but
i
kept
in
the
thick
woods
and
on
the
lookout
all
the
time
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
have
it
that
way
;
it
wouldn’t
do
at
all
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
know
what
i’s
gwyne
to
do
:
i’s
gwyne
to
set
down
here
and
listen
tell
i
hears
it
agin
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
a
good
going-over
in
the
morning
from
old
miss
watson
on
account
of
my
clothes
;
but
the
widow
she
didn’t
scold
,
but
only
cleaned
off
the
grease
and
clay
,
and
looked
so
sorry
that
i
thought
i
would
behave
awhile
if
i
could
.

knowed
a
potato
would
do
that
before
,
but
i
had
forgot
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
see
no
way
for
a
while
,
but
by
and
by
pap
raised
up
a
minute
to
drink
another
barrel
of
water
,
and
he
says
:
“another
time
a
man
comes
a-prowling
round
here
you
roust
me
out
,
you
hear
?

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
dozing
off
again
when
i
thinks
i
hears
a
deep
sound
of
“boom
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
getting
to
feel
that
way
myself
,
though
i’ve
always
reckoned
that
looking
at
the
new
moon
over
your
left
shoulder
is
one
of
the
carelessest
and
foolishest
things
a
body
can
do
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
there
,
and
he
was
up
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
i
warn’t
hurt
,
thanks
to
goodness
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
fooling
along
in
the
deep
woods
till
i
judged
i
warn’t
far
from
the
foot
of
the
island
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
felt
better
right
off
.
|
|
|
|
sheepish
enough
to
be
took
in
so
,
but
i
wouldn’t
a
been
in
that
ringmaster’s
place
,
not
for
a
thousand
dollars
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wuz
dah
all
night
.
|
|
|
|
|
had
a
notion
i
could
lan’
mos’
anywhers
,
but
i
couldn’t—bank
too
bluff
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
catched
my
breath
and
most
fainted
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fought
along
,
and
directly
i
hears
the
whoop
behind
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
warn’t
long
loosing
the
whoops
down
amongst
the
towheads
;
and
i
only
tried
to
chase
them
a
little
while
,
anyway
,
because
it
was
worse
than
chasing
a
jack-o’-lantern
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
seemed
to
be
in
the
open
river
again
by
and
by
,
but
i
couldn’t
hear
no
sign
of
a
whoop
nowheres
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
can
tell
you
it
made
me
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
,
too
,
to
hear
him
,
because
i
begun
to
get
it
through
my
head
that
he
was
most
free—and
who
was
to
blame
for
it
?
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gets
up
,
a-wondering
,
and
goes
down
stairs—nobody
around
;
everything
as
still
as
a
mouse
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bet
i
have—he
goes
to
our
church
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
says
to
myself
at
last
,
i’m
a-going
to
chance
it
;
i’ll
up
and
tell
the
truth
this
time
,
though
it
does
seem
most
like
setting
down
on
a
kag
of
powder
and
touching
it
off
just
to
see
where
you’ll
go
to
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
i
needed
the
watermelon
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tried
the
best
i
could
to
kinder
soften
it
up
somehow
for
myself
by
saying
i
was
brung
up
wicked
,
and
so
i
warn’t
so
much
to
blame
;
but
something
inside
of
me
kept
saying
,
“there
was
the
sunday-school
,
you
could
a
gone
to
it
;
and
if
you’d
a
done
it
they’d
a
learnt
you
there
that
people
that
acts
as
i’d
been
acting
about
that
nigger
goes
to
everlasting
fire
.

you’d
think
so
if
you’d
a
been
in

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
after
a
long
time
i
heard
the
clock
away
off
in
the
town
go
boom—boom—boom—twelve
licks
;
and
all
still
again—stiller
than
ever
.

dinner
friday
we
was
laying
around
in
the
grass
at
the
upper
end
of
the
ridge
,
and
got
out
of
tobacco
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
likely
it
was
minutes
and
minutes
that
there
warn’t
a
sound
,
and
we
all
there
so
close
together
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i’ve
noticed
that
thing
plenty
times
since
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
when
tom
and
me
got
to
the
edge
of
the
hilltop
we
looked
away
down
into
the
village
and
could
see
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
,
where
there
was
sick
folks
,
maybe
;
and
the
stars
over
us
was
sparkling
ever
so
fine
;
and
down
by
the
village
was
the
river
,
a
whole
mile
broad
,
and
awful
still
and
grand
.

he
give
a
fellow
a
quarter
and
told
him
to
tend
door
for
him
a
minute
,
and
then
he
started
around
for
the
stage
door
,
i
after
him
;
but
the
minute
we
turned
the
corner
and
was
in
the
dark
he
says
:
“walk
fast
now
till
you
get
away
from
the
houses
,
and
then
shin
for
the
raft
like

it
come
to
that
it
worked
the
crowd
like
you
never
see
anything
like
it
,
and
everybody
broke
down
and
went
to
sobbing
right
out
loud—the
poor
girls
,
too
;
and
every
woman
,
nearly
,
went
up
to
the
girls
,
without
saying
a
word
,
and
kissed
them
,
solemn
,
on
the
forehead
,
and
then
put
their
hand
on
their
head
,
and
looked
up
towards
the
sky
,
with
the
tears
running
down
,
and
then
busted
out
and
went
off
sobbing
and
swabbing
,
and
give
the
next
woman
a

nobody
could
think

,
and
set
still
.

an
hour
after

come
along
down

trading-scow
,
and
it
was
so
dark
we
didn’t
notice
the
wreck
till
we
was
right
on
it
;
and
so
we
saddle-baggsed
;

pretty
soon
the

again
,
and
then
he
went
for
judge
thatcher
in
the
courts
to
make
him
give
up
that
money
,
and
he
went
for

and
scrouging
and
pushing
and
shoving
to
get
at
the
window
and
have
a
look
,
but
people
that
had
the
places
wouldn’t
give
them
up
,
and
folks
behind

,
“say

fellows
;
‘tain’t

mad

|
|
|

it
was
a
good
long
job
,
but
i
was
getting
towards
the
end
of
it
when
i
heard
pap’s
gun
in
the
woods
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

pap
,
sure
enough—and
sober

too
,
by
the
way
he
laid
his
oars
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
being
away
in
the
night
and
stormy
,
and
all
so
mysterious-like
,
i
felt
just
the
way
any
other
boy
would
a
felt
when
i
see
that
wreck
laying
there
so
mournful
and
lonesome
in
the
middle
of
the
river
.

that
old
idiot
cut
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
is
their
turn
,
and
i’d
give
something
to
know
how
much
they’d
take
for
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
made
me
sick
to
see
it
;
and
i
was
sorry
for
them
poor
pitiful
rascals
,
it
seemed
like
i
couldn’t
ever
feel
any
hardness
against
them
any
more
in
the
world

,
about

through

hard
at

,
rigging
up

big
rocks
in

i
started
it
from

pig
,
and
dragged
it
to

through

on

broken-down
tree
you
could
see
rabbits
and
snakes
and
such
things
;
and
when
the
island
had
been
overflowed
a
day
or
two
they
got
so
tame
,
on
account
of
being
hungry
,
that
you
could
paddle
right
up
and
put
your
hand
on
them
if
you
wanted
to
;
but
not
the
snakes
and
turtles—they
would
slide
off
in
the
water

the

how
the

with

make
fast
,
there
warn’t

you
could
hear
him
over
everybody
;
and
next
he
went
a-charging
up
on
to
the
platform
,
and
the
preacher
he
begged
him
to

gathered
around

sympathized
with

,
and
said
all
sorts
of
kind
things
to
them
,
and
carried
their
carpet-bags
up
the
hill
for
them
,
and
let
them
lean
on
them
and
cry
,
and
told
the
king
all
about
his
brother’s
last
moments
,
and
the
king
he
told
it
all
over
again
on
his
hands
to
the
duke
,
and
both
of

took
on

very

the

there
was
a
big
outlandish
parrot
on

side
of
the
clock
,
made
out
of
something
like
chalk
,

painted

saying
about
the
parlor
,
there
was
beautiful
curtains
on
the
windows
:
white
,
with
pictures
painted
on
them
of
castles
with
vines
all
down
the
walls
,

cattle
coming
down

that
morning
till
everybody
was
settled
down
to
business
,
and
nobody
in

around
the
yard
;
then
tom
he
carried
the
sack
into
the

gurov

the

the

frightened

dare
not
leap
over
the
fence
you
have
put
round
it
;
and
when
you
jeer
at

which
you
pretend
to
know

about

you
are
like
the
deserter
fleeing
from

one
forgot
altogether
that

electricity

now
it

put
his
arm
round
ekaterina

waist
;
in
her
fright
she
nestled
up
to
him
,
and
he
could
not
restrain
himself
,

passionately
kissed
her
on
the

on

either
long

else

no
interest
for

,
but
i
had
the
sound
of
a
sweet
,
kind
voice
beside
me

so
that
the
meaning
of
all

summed

were
really
jobs
which
could
have
been
left
to
a
mechanic
,
but
the
officer
carried
them
out
with
great
enthusiasm
,
maybe
because
he
was
particularly
fond
of
this
apparatus
or
maybe
because
there
was
some
other
reason
why
one
could
not
trust
the

ten
o'clock
in

sat
with

all
the

midnight
went

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

walked
along
the
rows
where
fires
of
dung
,
straw
,
and
all
sorts
of
refuse
were
smouldering
,
and
from
time
to
time
they
were
met
by

wandered
in
the

not
feel
sleepy
;
he
talked
to
the
old
man
and
went
to
the
garden
with
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
listened
with
eagerness
to
the
music
and
singing
,
and
was
exhausted
by
it
,
and
this
showed
itself
by
his
eyes
closing
and
his
head
falling
to
one
side
.

|
|

to

were
russian—and
could
not
understand
their
meaning

|
|
|
|
|
|
,
racking
his
brains
to
remember
where
he
had
read
or
heard
the
legend
,
turned
slowly
towards
the
park
,
and
unconsciously
went
as
far
as
the
river
.

crossed
to
the
other
side
by
the
narrow
bridge
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stood
still
in
amazement
.
|
|
|
|
|
moved
aside
into
the
rye
to
make
way
for
it
,
and
only
just
had
time
to
do
so
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
on
reading
the
articles
,
but
he
understood
nothing
of
them
,
and
flung
them
aside
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
out
on
to
the
balcony
;
it
was
still
warm
weather
and
there
was
a
smell
of
the
sea
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
absorbed
in
his
interesting
work
,
but
at
last
he
,
too
,
felt
dreary
and
uncomfortable
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
delighted
,
and
very
adroitly
began
a
conversation
with
yegor
semyonitch
and
tanya
of
what
might
be
of
interest
to
the
monk
;
the
black-robed
visitor
listened
and
nodded
his
head
graciously
,
and
yegor
semyonitch
and
tanya
listened
,
too
,
and
smiled
gaily
without
suspecting
that
kovrin
was
not
talking
to
them
but
to
his
hallucination
.

looked
at

and
could
not
distinguish
his
face
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
put
out
the
light
and
lay
down
to
sleep
,
lay
for
a
long
time
with
his
eyes
closed
,
but
could
not
get
to
sleep
because
,
as
he
fancied
,
the
room
was
very
hot
and
tanya
talked
in
her
sleep

had
recovered
;
he
had
left
off
seeing
the
black
monk
,
and
he
had
only
to
get
up
his
strength
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

the
raptures
of
the
previous
summer
when
there
had
been
the
same
scent
of
the
marvel

the

shone
in
at

made
an
effort
,
tore
open
the
envelope
,
and
,
going
back
into
his
room
,
read
:

recognised
clearly
,
now
,
that
he
was
a

readily

there
was

pang
of
sadness
at
his

a
thrill
of
the
sweet
,
exquisite
delight
he

there
seemed

every
added
repulse
of

i

tended

lessen

he
had
to
tell
himself
that
here
it
was
a
matter
of
a
penal
colony
,
that
in
this
place
special
regulations
were
necessary
,
and
that
one
had
to
give
precedence
to
military
measures

when
he
now
bent
over
the
harrow
,
once
the
last
gear
wheel
had
left
the
inscriber
,
he
had
a
new
,
even

surprise

must
have
broken
free
of
them
soon
,
because
by
the
time
the
traveler
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
long
staircase

led
to
the

"styopka

unutterably
glad
.

foreseeing
a
long
,
bright
,
cheerful
day
,
kovrin
recollected
that
it
was
only
the
beginning
of
may
,
and
that
he
had
before
him
a
whole
summer
as
bright
,
cheerful
,
and
long
;
and
suddenly
there
stirred
in
his
bosom
a
joyous
,
youthful
feeling
,
such
as
he
used
to
experience
in
his
childhood
,
running
about
in
that
garden

began

close

possibly
he
may
be
seen
now
in

in

because
i
had
run
out
into
the
street
without
my
cap

goloshes
i
was
in
a
high
fever
.

in
its
brain
there
was
no
understanding
of
a
condition

very
cold

as
was
in

man’s
brain

cold

according

the
legend

we
may
look

to-morrow

i

indoors
they
began
singing
again
,
and
in
the
distance
the
violin
had
the
effect
of
a
human
voice

to
grow
larger
again
,
he
flew
across
the
river
,
collided
noiselessly
with
the
clay
bank
and
pines
,
and
passing
through
them
,
vanished
like
smoke

after
supper
,
when
the
visitors
had
gone
,
he
went
to
his
room
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
:
he
wanted
to
think
about
the
monk
.

we
had
visitors
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tiresome
stuff
.
|
|
|
what's
the
object
of
it
?
|
|
|
|
use
?
|
of
talking
!
|
|
|
|
trouble
?
|
|

altogether

my

very
queer

"however
,
this
is
idle
dreaming
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
concerning
the
trenching
of
the
soil
for
a
new
garden"
;
a
third
,
"additional
matter
concerning
grafting
with
a
dormant
bud"
;
and
they
were
all
of
the
same
sort
.

his
coats

i
reasoned
with
him
;

with
no
effect

small
,
pale
,
and
so
thin
that
her
shoulder-blades
stuck
out
,
her
eyes
,
wide
and
open
,
dark
and
intelligent
,
had
an
intent
gaze
,
as

looking

something

pieces
of
green
grass
stayed
on
the
sticks
,
and
he
bit
them
off
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
teeth
.

|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
restraining
the
unaccountable
joy
which
filled
his
whole
being
,
he
then
paced
up
and
down
again
,
and
sat
down
to
his
work
.

|
|
towards
morning
he
undressed
and
reluctantly
went
to
bed
:
he
ought
to
sleep
.

|

three
o'clock
,
when
it
was

to
get

the
door
creaked
cautiously

the
end
of
supper
the
wine
made
them
more
good-humoured
,
and
they
passed
to
more
lively
conversation
.

middle
of
the
day
the
undertaker
come
with
his
man
,
and
they
set
the
coffin
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
couple
of
chairs
,
and
then
set
all
our
chairs
in
rows
,
and
borrowed
more
from
the
neighbors
till
the
hall
and
the
parlor
and
the

we
tied
up

particular

out
crying

went
to
her
room

!

came
to
meet
him
in
the
park
:
she
was
by
now
wearing
a
different
dress

seeing
how
he
lashed
the
horse
,
and
seeing
how
he
pulled
his
cap
over
his
ears
,
understood
what
he
was
feeling
,
shut
herself
up
in
her
room

cried
the
whole
day

taken
her
unawares

she
had
,
since
she
was
fourteen
,
for
some
reason
been
convinced
that

tanya
,
kovrin
thought
that
,
apart
from
this
girl

her
father
,
he
might
hunt
the
world
over
and
would
not
find
people

as

nodding
his

graciously
,
this
beggar

pilgrim
came
noiselessly
to
the
seat

sat
down

him

without

live
in
full
understanding

freedom
,
mankind
would
be
of
little
account

down

true
enjoyment
lies
in
knowledge
,
and
eternal
life
provides
innumerable
and
inexhaustible
sources
of
knowledge
,
and
in
that
sense
it
has
been
said
:
'in
my
father's
house
there
are
many
mansions

of
work

at
this
point
the
way

reflections
upon
the
neurasthenia

exhaustion

degeneracy

et

can
only
seriously
agitate
those
who
place
the
object
of

in
the
present—that

the

that
distinguishes
prophets

repellent

imperceptibly
the
fast
of

assumption
was
approaching
,
and
soon
after
came
the
wedding
,
which
,
at
yegor
semyonitch's
urgent
desire
,
was
celebrated
with
"a

one
long
winter
night
kovrin
was
lying
in

,
reading
a
french
novel

|
|
|

|
|
|

now
that
i
am
writing
these
lines
i
am
restrained
by
that
dread
of
appearing
sentimental
and
ridiculous
,
in
which
i
have
been
trained
from
childhood
;
when
i
want
to
be
affectionate
or
to
say
anything
tender
,
i
don't
know
how
to
be
natural

"good-morning
,"
said
the
monk
,
and
after
a
brief
pause
he
asked
:
"what
are
you
thinking

there

,
after

he
found
himself
at

i
knew
more
about
him

any

else

he
wished
me
to
appear
at

you
see
how
the
execution
is
a
sad
procedure

without

left
alone

turned
cold
.
|
|
|
saw
only
a
fat
,
plain
face
,
distorted
by
an
expression
of
repulsion
,
and
he
himself
suddenly
felt
a

open

off

he
twitched
his

was
wearing
a
little
russian
dress
which
did
not
suit
her
at
all
,
and
made
her
look
clumsy
;
the

was
making
dull

vulgar
jokes

some

about
half
a
mile
from
the
station
,
he
sat
down
on
a
stone
by
the
side
of
the
road
,
and
gazed
at
the
sun
,
which
was
half
hidden
behind

twelve
o’clock

out

went
along
up
the
bank
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
this
time
i
mighty
near
stepped
on
a
good-sized
snake
,
and
it
went
sliding
off
through
the
grass
and
flowers
,
and
i
after
it
,
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
it

an
hour
after
dinner
everybody
was
dozing
around
,
some
in
their
chairs

some
in
their
rooms
,
and
it
got
to
be
pretty
dull
.

or
two
ago
it
would
a
been
a
little
different
,
but
now
it
made
me
feel
bad
and
disappointed
,
the
king
rips
out
and
says
:
“what

they
come
up
again
,
though
,
and
jim
was
going
to
call
me
;
but
he
changed
his
mind
,
because
he
reckoned
they
warn’t
high
enough
yet
to
do
any
harm
;
but
he
was
mistaken
about
that
,
for
pretty
soon
all
of
a
sudden
along
comes
a
regular
ripper
and
washed
me
overboard

flocked
down
when
they

the

of

a
couple
of
little
boats
come
along
,
but
they
didn’t
come
from
high
enough
up
the
river
;

at
last
there
was
a
big
one
,

they

i
hears
their
footsteps
coming
,

was
going
to
skip
under
the
bed
;
i
reached
for
it
,
but
it
wasn’t
where
i
thought
it
would
be
;
but
i
touched
the
curtain
that
hid
mary
jane’s
frocks
,
so
i
jumped
in
behind
that
and
snuggled
in
amongst
the

stood
there

still

the

come
up
in
the
garret
and
woke
me
up
,

next

he
would
be
as
free
as
a
bird
;
he
would
put
on
ordinary
clothes
instead
of
his
school
uniform
,
would
smoke
openly
,
come
out
here
,
and
make
love
to
nyuta

,
towards
night
,
we
laid
up
under
a
little
willow
towhead
out
in
the
middle
,
where
there
was
a
village
on
each
side
of
the
river
,
and
the
duke
and
the
king
begun
to
lay
out
a

morning
the
waiter
,
handing
me
my
clothes
,
informed
me
,
with
a
smile
,
that
the
lady
in
number
thirteen
was
confined
.

i
said
it
was
getting
slow
and
dull
,
and
i
wanted
to
get
a
stirring
up
some
way
.

heard
tom

a
good

better
,

they
said

was
gone
to
get
a
nap
.

,
‘chop
off
her
head
!
|
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
he
gathered
dry
grasses
and
tiny
sticks
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
brought
out
his
pack
of
matches
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
says
:
“do
you
go
to
church
,
too
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

time
he
would
merely
walk
and
keep
going
.

you
roust
me
out
,
you
hear
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
i
got
to
itching
underneath
.
|
|
|
|
|
noticed
that
buck
was
up
and
gone
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
slid
into
the
river
and
had
a
swim
,
so
as
to
freshen
up
and
cool
off
;
then
we
set
down
on
the
sandy
bottom
where
the
water
was
about
knee
deep
,
and
watched
the
daylight
come
.

you’d
see
a
raft
sliding
by
,
away
off
yonder
,
and
maybe
a
galoot
on
it
chopping
,
because
they’re
most
always
doing
it
on
a
raft
;
you’d
see
the
axe
flash
and
come
down—you
don’t
hear
nothing
;
you
see
that
axe
go
up
again
,
and
by
the
time
it’s
above
the
man’s
head
then
you
hear
the
k’chunk

up-stream
,
so
far
off
towards
the

side
you
couldn’t
tell
nothing
about
her
only
whether
she
was
a
stern-wheel

side-wheel

for
about
an

orlov
was
absolutely
uninterested

looked

by

:
on

way
home
from

she
had
"hooked
an
officer
on
the
nevsky
,"
who
had
,
it
appears
,
taken
her
home
with
him
,
and
had
only
let
her
go
late
in
the
evening
;
and
she
hastened
to
write
about
this
to
her
school
friend
to

her
joy

her

zinaida
fyodorovna
,
as
i

went
to
the

spend
with

the

was
standing

|

rejected
with
disgust
children

cooking
,
copper
saucepans
,
and
feminine
knicknacks
and
i
gathered
them
all
up
,
tenderly
cherished
them
in
my

loved
them

them

asked
her
not
to
broach
the
question
of
moving
until
after
they
had
come
back
from
abroad
,
and
apropos
of
their
foreign
tour
,
declared
that
they
could
not
go
till
his
hair
had
grown
long

out

went
out

tidying
the

the

rummaging
in

the
snow
above

had

the

did
not

|
|

|

,
thought
i
,
it
is
evident
enough
that
bartleby
has
been
making
his
home
here
,
keeping
bachelor’s
hall
all
by
himself
.

i
was
sorry
for
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
certain
melancholy
mixed
with
this
:
i
was
almost
sorry
for
my
brilliant
success
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
here
i
hardly
know
whether
i
should
divulge
one
little
item
of
rumor
,
which
came
to
my
ear
a
few
months
after
the
scrivener’s
decease
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
working
carefully
from
a
small
beginning
,
he
soon
had
a
roaring
fire
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bending
over
the
fire
,
he
first
melted
the
ice
from
his
face
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
70
to
build
a
fire
and
then
it
happened
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
placing
it
on
the
foundation
,
he
fed
the
young
flame
with
pieces
of
dry
grass
and
with
the
smallest
dry
sticks
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nose
and
face
were
already
freezing
,
while
the
skin
of
all
his
body
became
cold
as
it
lost
its
blood
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
toes
and
nose
and
face
would
be
only
touched
by
the
frost
,
because
the
fire
was
beginning
to
burn
with
strength
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

any
man
who
was
a
man
could
travel
alone

tell
you
that

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
high
up
in
the
tree
one
branch
dropped
its
load
of
snow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
running
would
not
bring
life
to
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
freezing
was
not
as
bad
as
people
thought
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
“you
were
right
,
old
fellow
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
don’t
even
know
that
?
|
|
|
|
|

,”
the
officer
said
,
“two
sorts
of
needles
in
a
multiple
arrangement
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
could
do
it
,”
repeated
the
officer
,
even
more
emphatically
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
are
free
,”
the
officer
told
the
condemned
man
in
his
own
language
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
now

said
the
officer
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
shall
,
then
,
before
you’re
three
days
older

says
the
duke
.

didn’t
want
to
come
.
|
|
|
|
|
talk
like
an
englishman
,
don’t
you
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
later
,
the
dog
howled
loudly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bartleby
was
one
of
those
beings
of
whom
nothing
is
ascertainable
,
except
from
the
original
sources
,
and
in
his
case
those
are
very
small
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
to
be
seen
.
|
|
|
|
|
there
.
|
|
|
and
i
were
alone
.
|
|
|
|
|
never
came
nigh
me
.

|

|
|

1
ere
introducing
the
scrivener
,
as
he
first
appeared
to
me
,
it
is
fit
i
make
some
mention
of
myself
,
my
employées
,
my
business
,
my
chambers
,
and
general
surroundings
;
because
some
such
description
is
indispensable
to
an
adequate
understanding
of
the
chief
character
about
to
be
presented
.

imprimis
:
i
am
a
man
who
,
from
his
youth
upwards
,
has
been
filled
with
a
profound
conviction
that
the
easiest
way
of
life
is
the
best
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

hence
,
though
i
belong
to
a
profession
proverbially
energetic
and
nervous
,
even
to
turbulence
,
at
times
,
yet
nothing
of
that
sort
have
i
ever
suffered
to
invade
my
peace
.

some
time
prior
to
the
period
at
which
this
little
history
begins
,
my
avocations
had
been
largely
increased
.
|
|

my
chambers
were
up
stairs
at
no
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
.
|
|
—
wall-street
.
|
|
|
”
but
if
so
,
the
view
from
the
other
end
of
my
chambers
offered
,
at
least
,
a
contrast
,
if
nothing
more
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
the
traveler
said
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
|
it
didn’t
budge
.
|
|
|
warn’t
.
|
|
|
jim
was
dead
against
it
at
first
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that
idea
was
a
failure
;
for
pretty
soon
it
begun
to
storm
again
,
and
this
time
worse
than
ever
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
warn’t
no
answer
,
and
nobody
come
out
of
the
wigwam
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
ducked
their
heads
,
and
put
their
fingers
in
their
mouths
,
and
hid
behind
her
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
never
heard
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
then
we
heard
the
tramp
of
men
coming
to
the
door
,
and
heard
them
begin
to
fumble
with
the
pad-lock
,
and
heard
a
man
say
:
“i
told
you
we’d
be
too
soon
;
they
haven’t
come—the
door
is
locked
.

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
didn’t
answer
;
we
just
unfurled
our
heels
and
shoved
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
me
and
jim
was
consulting—and
thinking
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
tom
,
he
was
so
proud
and
joyful
,
he
just
couldn’t
hold
in
,
and
his
tongue
just
went
it—she
a-chipping
in
,
and
spitting
fire
all
along
,
and
both
of
them
going
it
at
once
,
like
a
cat
convention
;
and
she
says
:
“well
,
you
get
all
the
enjoyment
you
can
out
of
it
now
,
for
mind
i
tell
you
if
i
catch
you
meddling
with
him
again—”
“meddling
with
who

i
kept
at
him
;
so
at
last
he
says
:
“doan’
you
‘member
de
house

was
float’n
down
de

,
en

this
appeal
to
my
fellow-feeling
was
hardly
to
be
resisted
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

now
my
original
business—that
of
a
conveyancer
and
title
hunter
,
and
drawer-up
of
recondite
documents
of
all
sorts—was
considerably
increased
by
receiving
the
master’s
office
.

i
sat
awhile
in
perfect
silence
,
rallying
my
stunned
faculties
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
22
“prefer
not
to
,”
echoed
i
,
rising
in
high
excitement
,
and
crossing
the
room
with
a
stride
.

|
|

|

i
heard
a
slow
scrape
of
his
chair
legs
on
the
uncarpeted
floor
,
and
soon
he
appeared
standing
at
the
entrance
of
his
hermitage
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

said
he
mildly
.
|
|
|
i
,
after
waiting
a
considerable
time
for
a
reply
,
during
which
his
countenance
remained
immovable
,
only
there
was
the
faintest
conceivable
tremor
of
the
white
attenuated
mouth
.

the
grub-man
,
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
which
seem
to
say
he
was
all
impatience
for
an
opportunity
to
give
a
specimen
of
his
breeding

astonishment

traveler
,
wiping
his
forehead
,
“then

“i

34
with
any
other
man
i
should
have
flown
outright
into
a
dreadful
passion
,
scorned
all
further
words
,

thrust
him
ignominiously
from
my

“i

he
replied
in
a
flute-like
tone
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
38
he
briefly
gave
me
to
understand
that
on
that
point
my
judgment
was
sound
.

“with

said

(the

of

perceptions
will
here
perceive
that
,
it
being

,
turkey’s
answer
is
couched
in

it
was
afternoon
,
be
it
remembered
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
roared
turkey
;
“i
think
i’ll
just
step
behind
his
screen
,
and
black
his
eyes
for
him
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

61
so
saying
,
turkey
rose
to
his
feet
and
threw
his
arms
into
a
pugilistic
position
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

63
“excuse
me

|
|
64
“ah
,”
exclaimed
i
,
“you
have
strangely
changed
your
mind
then—you
speak
very
gently
of
him
now
.

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

65
“all
beer
,”
cried
turkey
;
“gentleness
is
effects
of
beer—nippers
and
i
dined
together
to-day
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

66
“you
refer

bartleby
,
i
suppose
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
67
i
closed
the
doors
,
and
again
advanced
towards
bartleby
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
69
“i
would
prefer

|

|

|

70
“you
will
not
?
|
|
|
|
|
71
“i
prefer
not
.
|
|
|
|
|
72
i
staggered
to
my
desk
,
and
sat
there
in
a
deep
study
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
74
no
answer
.
|
|
|
|
80
“i
prefer
not
to
,”
he
respectfully
and
slowly
said
,
and
mildly
disappeared
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
98
upon
this
he
noiselessly
slid
into
view
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
100
“i
would
prefer
not
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
101
“will
you
tell
me
any
thing
about
yourself
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
102
“i
would
prefer
not

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
103
“but
what
reasonable
objection
can
you
have
to
speak
to
me
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
104
he
did
not
look
at
me
while
i
spoke
,
but
kept
his
glance
fixed
upon
my
bust
of
cicero
,
which
as
i
then
sat
,
was
directly
behind
me
,
some
six
inches
above
my
head
.

|
|
109
“at
present
i
would
prefer
not
to
be
a
little
reasonable
,”
was
his
mildly
cadaverous
reply
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gritted
nippers—“i’d
prefer
him
,
if
i
were
you
,

addressing
me—“i’d
prefer
him
;
i’d
give
him
preferences

bartleby
moved
not
a
limb
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
114
somehow
,
of
late
i
had
got
into
the
way
of
involuntarily
using
this
word
“prefer”
upon
all
sorts
of
not
exactly
suitable
occasions
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
117
“so
you
have
got
the
word
too
,”
said
i
,
slightly
excited
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
119
“i
would
prefer
to
be
left
alone
here
,”
said
bartleby
,
as
if
offended
at
being
mobbed
in
his
privacy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

121
“oh
,
prefer
?
|
|
|
|
|
123
“oh
,
certainly
,
sir
,
if
you
prefer
that
i
should
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
124
as
he
opened
the
folding-door
to
retire
,
nippers
at
his
desk
caught
a
glimpse
of
me
,
and
asked
whether
i
would
prefer
to
have
a
certain
paper
copied
on
blue
paper
or
white
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
exclaimed
i
,
“do
no
more
writing
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
;
“suppose
your
eyes
should
get
entirely
well—better
than
ever
before—would
you
not
copy
then
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
127
“no
more
.
|
|
|
|
128
“and
what
is
the
reason
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
129
“do
you
not
see
the
reason
for
yourself
,”
he
indifferently
replied
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
134
“i
have
given
up
copying
,”
he
answered
,
and
slid
aside
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
136
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
,
i
peeped
behind
the
screen
,
and
lo
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
138
“i
would
prefer
not
,”
he
replied
,
with
his
back
still
towards
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
140
he
remained
silent
.
|
|
|
|
|
and
i
handed
the
bills
towards
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
nobody
didn’t
altogether
believe
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
while
he
put
the
chain
in
place
,
he
kept
talking
,
“our
resources
for
maintaining
the
machine

very
limited
at

the
officer
gripped
the
traveler
by
both
arms
and
looked
at
him
,
breathing
heavily
into
his
face
.

cannon
let
off
such
a
blast
right
before
me
that
it
made
me
deef
with
the
noise
and
pretty
near
blind
with
the
smoke
,

i

by
and
by
all

dropped
the
reins
,
and
every
lady
put
her
knuckles
on
her
hips
and
every
gentleman
folded
his

then
how
the

he

by
jings

he

that
nigger
was
corked
up

had
to

seat

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
skipped
out

he
said
:
"ef

,
it’s

answered
up

right
at
my
elbow
,
with
a
sort
of
a
moan
,
and
i
says
:
“quick
,
jim
,
it
ain’t
no
time
for
fooling
around
and
moaning
;
there’s
a
gang
of
murderers
in
yonder
,
and
if
we
don’t
hunt
up
their
boat
and
set
her
drifting
down
the
river
so
these
fellows
can’t
get
away
from
the
wreck
there’s

eye
with
a
rag
.

every

he
said

|
|

once
he
said

in
he
come
,
and
bill
after
him

so
on
,
and
a
body
could
see
it
was
mighty
pleasing
to
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
went
on
,
and
the
people
groaning
and
crying

saying
amen

“oh

bench

calling
sherburn
everything
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
,
and
the
whole
street
packed
with
people
listening
and
laughing
and
going
on

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
a-mumbling
up
stairs
,
and
then
we
left
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a-mooning
on
and
on
,
liking
to
hear
himself
talk
,
and
every
little
while
he
fetched
in
his
funeral
orgies
again
,
till
the
duke
he
couldn’t
stand
it
no
more
;
so
he
writes
on
a
little
scrap
of
paper
,
“obsequies
,
you
old
fool
,”
and
folds
it
up
,
and
goes
to
goo-gooing

reaching
it
over

heads
to
him

people
would
shout
out

“glory

|
|
|

away
the
sow
would
go
,
squealing
most
horrible
,
with
a
dog
or
two
swinging
to
each
ear
,
and
three
or
four
dozen
more
a-coming
;
and
then
you
would
see
all
the
loafers
get
up
and
watch
the
thing
out
of
sight
,
and
laugh
at
the
fun

he
went

then
fetched
his
cane
down
slow
to
a
level
,
and
says
“bang

tom
he
talked
along

talked
along
,
and
says
,
le’s
all
three
slide
out
of
here
one
of
these
nights
and
get
an
outfit
,
and
go
for
howling
adventures
amongst
the
injuns
,
over
in
the
territory
,
for
a
couple
of
weeks
or
two
;
and
i
says
,
all
right
,
that
suits
me
,
but
i
ain’t
got
no
money
for
to
buy
the
outfit
,
and
i
reckon
i
couldn’t
get
none
from
home
,
because
it’s
likely
pap’s
been
back
before
now
,
and
got
it
all
away
from
judge
thatcher

drunk
it
up

and
what
was
left
of
the
butter
,
and
she
grabbed
me
,
and
hugged
me
,
and
says
:
“oh
,
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
!

|
|

|
|
|
|
shook
me
up
again
,
and
said
he
reckoned
he’d
drownd
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
fetched
first
one
and
then
another
of
them
a
clip
and
sent
them
howling
,
and
then
the
rest
followed
;
and
the
next
second
half
of
them
come
back
,
wagging
their
tails
around
me
,
and
making
friends
with
me
.

looked
huffy
and
bothered
both
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
snatched
a
kiss
of
him
,
and
flew
for
the
house
to
get
the
bed
ready
,
and
scattering
orders
right
and
left
at
the
niggers
and
everybody
else
,
as
fast
as
her
tongue
could
go
,
every
jump
of
the
way
.

it
stopped
alongside
,
and
his
mouth
opened
up
like
a
trunk
,
and
stayed
so
;
and
he
swallowed
two
or
three
times
like
a
person
that’s
got
a
dry
throat
,
and
then
says
:
“i
hain’t
ever
done
you
no
harm
.

turns
to
me
,
perfectly
ca’m
,
and
says
,
“did
you
hear
anybody
sing
out
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
whilst
the
nigger
stepped
to
the
door
to
look
at
the
dime
and
bite
it
to
see
if
it
was
good
,
he
whispers
to
jim
and
says
:
“don’t
ever
let
on
to
know
us

he
turned
his
head
a
little
,
and
muttered
something
or
other
,
which
showed
he
warn’t
in
his
right
mind
;
then
she
flung
up
her
hands
,
and
says
:
“he’s
alive

thank
god

but
he
answered
not
a
word
;
like
the
last
column
of
some
ruined
temple
,
he
remained
standing
mute
and
solitary
in
the
middle
of
the
otherwise
deserted
room
.

i
was
instinctively
putting
my
hand
in
my
pocket
to
produce
my
own
,
when
i
remembered
that
this
was
an
election
day
.
|
|
|
|

it
was
bartleby
.
|
|
|
|
|
i
murmured
at
last
.
|
|
|
|
now
demanded
in
a
sudden
passion
,
advancing
close
to
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
rather
absurdly
concluded
,
knowing
not
with
what
possible
threat
to
try
to
frighten
his
immobility
into
compliance
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
all
this
over
for
two
or
three
days
,
and
then
i
reckoned
i
would
see
if
there
was
anything
in
it
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

says
,
“don’t
you
ask
me
no
questions
about
it
,
please
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
begun
to
cry
;
“why
,
he
was
my
nigger
,
and
that
was
my
money
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
;
“why
,
they
get
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
if
they
want
it
;
they
can
have
just
as
much
as
they
want
;
everything
belongs
to
them
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

there
ain’t
no
necessity
for
it
.

|
|
|
|
|

“you’re
joking
.
|
|
|
“your
head
gets
leveler
and
leveler
all
the
time
,
tom
sawyer
,”
i
says
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
:
“i’ll
take
the
canoe
and
go
and
see
,
jim
.

|

“it’s
me
.

“all
right—that’s
mighty
good
;
they
won’t
find
me
,
and
they’ll
think
i’ve
been
killed
,
and
floated
down
the
river—there’s
something
up
there
that
‘ll
help
them
think
so—so
don’t
you
lose
no
time
,
jim
,
but
just
shove
off
for
the
big
water
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
.

right

wait
a
minute
.

“no
,
your

we
warn’t—please
don’t
,
your

“why

just
what
i
was
going

ask
your
grace
.

“i

|

|
|
|
|

“what
do
we
want
of
a
moat
when
we’re
going
to
snake
him
out
from
under
the
cabin
?

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|

.
|
to
myself
,
this
is
a
girl
that
i’m
letting
that
old
reptile
rob
her
of
her
money
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
yes
;
and
him
and
some
others
laughed
,
and
said
,
“stuff
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
took
up
a
book
and
begun
something
about
general
washington
and
the
wars
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
river
road
as
hard
as
i
could
put
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
never
see
a
man
look
so
wild
in
the
eyes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
such
a
nigger
.
|
|
|
|
|
felt
easy
till
the
raft
was
two
mile
below
there
and
out
in
the
middle
of
the
mississippi
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
nothing
,
because
i
warn’t
expecting
nothing
different
;
but
i
knowed
mighty
well
that
whenever
he
got
his
plan
ready
it
wouldn’t
have
none
of
them
objections
to
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
around
,
trying
to
make
out
where
i
was
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
judged
he
didn’t
know
nothing
about
what
he
had
been
doing
,
so
i
says
:
“somebody
tried
to
get
in
,
so
i
was
laying
for
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
heard
that
just
as
plain
as
if
the
man
was
by
my
side
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
people
stirring
around
in
the
house
now
,
and
see
a
light
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
see
the
white
smoke
squirt
out
of
the
ferryboat’s
side
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
warn’t
no
use
wasting
words—you
can’t
learn
a
nigger
to
argue
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nothing
but
a
dictionary
,
so
i
laid
my
hand
on
it
and
said
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
what
he
was
up
to
;
but
i
never
said
nothing
,
of
course
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
was
up
a
stump
.
|
|
|
|
in
a
fix
now
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
my
chance
;
so
i
skips
up
and
says
:
“i’ll
run
right
up
to
town
and
get
him
,”
i
says
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
didn’t
hope
so
.
|
|
|
wait
,
but
shoved
out
and
paddled
away
easy
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
answer
up
prompt
.
|
|
|
|
hurry
;
i
couldn’t
if
i’d
a
wanted
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
have
to
be
ordered
twice
to
go
and
take
a
steamboat
ride
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
none
,
so
he
left
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
want
to
set
her
to
thinking
about
her
troubles
again
;
and
i
couldn’t
seem
to
get
my
mouth
to
tell
her
what
would
make
her
see
that
corpse
laying
in
the
coffin
with
that
bag
of
money
on
his
stomach
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
care
nothing
for
the
compliment
,
but
i
was
glad
to
be
let
off
,
anyway
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
rightly
know
what
to
say
,
because
i
didn’t
know
whether
the
boat
would
be
coming
up
the
river
or
down
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
know
just
what
to
do—but
then
i
thought
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
done
it
.
|
,
but
i
judged
they
would
take
it
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
he
done
the
same
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
feeling
better
then
,
but
i
wished
i
was
out
of
there
,
anyway
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
paddling
off
,
all
in
a
sweat
to
tell
on
him
;
but
when
he
says
this
,
it
seemed
to
kind
of
take
the
tuck
all
out
of
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
scared
,
now
,
i
tell
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
very
glad
to
hear
him
say
that
;
it
made
me
feel
much
more
easier
than
what
i
was
feeling
before
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
getting
so
uneasy
i
couldn’t
listen
good
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
up
stairs
in
a
second
,
and
down
the
lightning-rod
in
another
one
,
and
shinning
through
the
dark
for
the
lean-to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
going
to
say
yes
;
but
she
chipped
in
and
says
:
"about
what
,
sid
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
reckon
i
shook
like
a
leaf
,
and
i
didn’t
know
hardly
what
to
do
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
up
the
bank
about
fifty
yards
,
and
then
i
doubled
on
my
tracks
and
slipped
back
to
where
my
canoe
was
,
a
good
piece
below
the
house
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
couldn’t
hardly
hang
on
to
the
shutters
,
i
was
so
weak
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
think
of
anything
reasonable
,
right
off
that
way
,
so
i
says
:
“mumps
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
struck
for
the
light
,
but
as
soon
as
he
turned
the
corner
i
went
back
and
got
into
my
skiff
and
bailed
her
out
,
and
then
pulled
up
shore
in
the
easy
water
about
six
hundred
yards
,
and
tucked
myself
in
among
some
woodboats
;
for
i
couldn’t
rest
easy
till
i
could
see
the
ferryboat
start
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
got
to
feeling
so
mean
and
so
miserable
i
most
wished
i
was
dead
.

|
|
|
|
|
felt
easy
and
happy
and
light
as
a
feather
right
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
buckled
to
my
paddle
and
they
laid
to
their
oars
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
paddled
to
the
raft
.
|
|
|
|
|
set
it
down
,
private
,
because
somebody
might
want
me
to
spell
it
next
,
and
so
i
wanted
to
be
handy
with
it
and
rattle
it
off
like
i
was
used
to
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
followed
a
half
a
mile
;
then
he
struck
out
over
the
swamp
,
and
waded
ankle
deep
as
much
as
another
half-mile
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
don’t
want
to
talk
much
about
the
next
day
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
found
jim
had
been
trying
to
get
him
to
talk
french
,
so
he
could
hear
what
it
was
like
;
but
he
said
he
had
been
in
this
country
so
long
,
and
had
so
much
trouble
,
he’d
forgot
it
.
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
over
there
to
see
who
said
it
,
and
it
was
that
colonel
sherburn
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knowed
he
was
dead
years
ago
,
but
i
never
let
on
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
studied
awhile
and
see
my
chance
;
then
i
says
:
“well
,
i
see
the
niggers
go
in
there
several
times
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
out
with
a
“yes’m”
before
i
thought
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
i
had
got
it
on
the
boat
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
“don’t
do
nothing
of
the
kind
;
it’s
one
of
the
most
jackass
ideas
i
ever
struck
;”
but
he
never
paid
no
attention
to
me
;
went
right
on
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
hunched
tom
,
and
whispers
:
“you
going
,
right
here
in
the
daybreak
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
just
knowed
how
it
would
be
;
i
just
expected
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
reckoned
she’d
let
me
go
now
,
and
as
a
generl
thing
she
would
;
but
i
s’pose
there
was
so
many
strange
things
going
on
she
was
just
in
a
sweat
about
every
little
thing
that
warn’t
yard-stick
straight
;
so
she
says
,
very
decided
:
“you
just
march
into
that
setting-room
and
stay
there
till
i
come
.

allowed
another
walk
would
do
me
good
;
but
i
couldn’t
stir
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
wanted
to
offer
to
bet
two
dollars
she
hadn’t
,
but
i
reckoned
maybe
it
was
just
as
safe
to
not
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
160
he
answered
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
|
162
he
silently
retired
into
his
hermitage
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
yes
,
this
it
was
that
saved
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
under
the
circumstances
,
those
books
induced
a
salutary
feeling
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
173
he
made
no
reply
,
and
nothing
more
was
said
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
181
“i
am
very
sorry
,
sir
,”
said
i
,
with
assumed
tranquillity
,
but
an
inward
tremor
,
“but
,
really
,
the
man
you
allude
to
is
nothing
to
me—he
is
no
relation
or
apprentice
of
mine
,
that
you
should
hold
me
responsible
for
him
.

“in

he

|
|

183
“i
certainly
cannot

you

“i

him

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
185
several
days
passed
,
and
i
heard
nothing
more
;
and
though
i
often
felt
a
charitable
prompting
to
call
at
the
place
and
see
poor
bartleby
,
yet
a
certain
squeamishness
of
i
know
not
what
withheld
me
.

189
aghast
at
this
torrent
,
i
fell
back
before
it
,
and
would
fain
have
locked
myself
in
my
new
quarters
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

195
no
answer
.
|
|
|
|
197
“no
;
i
would
prefer
not
to
make
any
change
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
198
“would
you
like
a
clerkship
in
a
dry-goods
store
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
199
“there
is
too
much
confinement
about
that
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
200
“too
much
confinement
,”
i
cried
,
“why
you
keep
yourself
confined
all
the
time
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
201
“i
would
prefer
not
to
take
a
clerkship
,”
he
rejoined
,
as
if
to
settle
that
little
item
at
once
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

203
“i
would
not
like
it
at
all
;
though
,
as
i
said
before
,
i
am
not
particular
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
204
his
unwonted
wordiness
inspirited
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
206
“no
,
i
would
prefer
to
be
doing
something
else

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

207
“how
then
would
going
as
a
companion
to
europe
,
to
entertain
some
young
gentleman
with
your
conversation
,—how
would
that
suit
you
?

208
“not
at
all
.
|
|
|
|
|
209
“stationary
you
shall
be
then
,”
i
cried
,
now
losing
all
patience
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
my
exasperating
connection
with
him
fairly
flying
into
a
passion
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

“no

at

i
would

make
any
change
at
all

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
212
i
answered
nothing
;
but
effectually
dodging
every
one
by
the
suddenness
and
rapidity
of
my
flight
,
rushed
from
the
building
,
ran
up
wall-street
towards
broadway
,
and
jumping
into
the
first
omnibus
was
soon
removed
from
pursuit
.

219
“i
know
you
,”
he
said
,
without
looking
round
,—“and
i
want
nothing
to
say
to
you
.
|

220
“it
was
not
i
that
brought
you
here
,
bartleby
,”
said
i
,
keenly
pained
at
his
implied
suspicion
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

221
“i
know
where
i
am
,”
he
replied
,
but
would
say
nothing
more
,
and
so
i
left
him
.
|

|
|
|
|

|
|

“yes

224
“does
he
want
to
starve
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
225
“who
are
you
?
|
|
|
|
|
asked
i
,
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
such
an
unofficially
speaking
person
in
such
a
place
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
the
traveler
and
bent
down
.
|
|
|
|
.
|
uneasily
.
|
|
,
who
could
not
believe
the
soldier
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
officer
in
astonishment
and
bit
his
lip
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
227
“is
this
so
?
|
|
|
|
|
230
“introduce
me
,
will
you
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
233
“your
sarvant
,
sir
,
your
sarvant
,”
said
the
grub-man
,
making
a
low
salutation
behind
his
apron
.
|
|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|

“i
prefer
not
to
dine
to-day
,”
said
bartleby
,
turning
away
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
saying
he
slowly
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
inclosure
,
and
took
up
a
position
fronting
the
dead-wall
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
signed
it
,
and
left
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
it
wouldn’t
be
no
use
to
try
to
play
it
any
longer
,
and
i
would
just
make
a
clean
breast
and
tell
her
everything
,
but
she
musn’t
go
back
on
her
promise

jim
was
to

woods
when
he

the

coming

was
gone
again

promised
,
and
he
says
:
“a
farmer
by
the
name

and
then
he
stopped
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

done

slipped
back
the
one
i

,
and
when
she
got
done
counting
,
she
says

we
went
over
to
where
the
canoe
was
,

while
he
built
a
fire
in
a
grassy
open
place
amongst
the
trees
,
i
fetched
meal
and
bacon
and
coffee
,
and
coffee-pot
and
frying-pan
,
and
sugar
and
tin
cups
,
and
the
nigger
was
set
back
considerable
,
because
he
reckoned
it
was
all
done
with
witchcraft

she
dropped
the
lump
into
my
lap
just
at
that
moment
,
and
i
clapped
my
legs
together
on
it
and
she
went
on
talking

didn’t
lose

asked
him
;

hugged
him
and
kissed
him
over
and
over
again
,
and
then
turned
him
over
to
the

they
started
,

i

out

all
in

cold
sweat

scrambled
forward

some

the
king
he
set
down
and
twisted
his
head
to
one
side
,
and
chawed
his
tongue
,
and
scrawled
off
something
;

then
they
give
the
pen
to
the

then
for

the
duke

the

his

;

so
in
about
a
half
an
hour
they
was
as
thick
as

again
,

the
tighter
they

the

we

said

,
sadly
.

touchingly
,

cried
and
climbed
back
down
the
ladder
.

asked
finally
,
as
he
pulled
out
a
chair
from
a
pile
of
cane
chairs

offered
it
to
the
traveler

him
over
to
the

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
old
man
by
the
hand
and
squeezed
it
,
and

,
“that

it
and
bit
it
to
see
if
it
was
good
,
and
then
he
said
he
was
going
down
town
to
get
some
whisky
;
said
he

a
curse
on
his
lips

controlled
himself

said
merely
:

|
|
|
|
urged
the
traveler
to
sit
down
in
his
chair
,
moved
to
the
apparatus
again
,
and
started
,
“as

the

way

give
the
most
comprehensive
explanation

jumped
up

and
got
the
canoe
ready
,
and
put
his
old
coat
in
the
bottom
for
me
to
set
on
,
and
give
me
the
paddle
;
and
as
i
shoved
off
,
he
says
:
“pooty

we

kind
of
pettish

there
a-mumbling

out
up

kinder

stood
there

up
his

looks
at
him
stupid

leather-headed
a

he
seems
to
catch
his

,
and
jumps
for
the
king

goo-gooing
with

got
up
and
looked
distressed
,
and
fumbled
his
hat
,
and
says
:
“i’m
sorry
,
and
i
warn’t
expecting
it

said
that

|
|
|
|
|
never
said
nothing
.
|
|
|
|
only
just
looked
scornful
,
and
said
something
about
nobody
ever
heard
of
such
an
idiotic
idea
,
and
then
he
went
to
studying
.

some
few
days
after
this
,
i
again
obtained
admission
to
the
tombs
,
and
went
through
the
corridors
in
quest
of

without
finding
him

went

the

was
entirely
quiet

“lives

said
i

closed
the

“now

have
a
look
at
this
apparatus

he
added
immediately
,
drying
his
hands
with
a
towel
and
pointing
to
the
device

the

nodded
and
followed
the
officer
.

made
an
vague
gesture
with
his
hand

was
already
being
won
over

little
to
the
apparatus

thinking
:
it’s
always
questionable

intervene
decisively
in
strange
circumstances

really
wanted
to
keep
quiet
at
this
point
,
but
he
felt
how
the
condemned
man
was
gazing
at
him—he
seemed
to
be
asking
whether
he
could
approve
of
the
process
the
officer
had
described
.

moved
up

bent
over
the
harrow

had
leaned
his
ear
towards
the
officer
and
,
with
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
,
was
observing
the
machine
at
work

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

to
suppress
a
smile
.
|
|
|
|
|

wanted
to
turn
his
face
away
from
the

looked
aimlessly
around
him

did
not
let

go
on
talking

bent
so
low
over
the
paper
that
the
officer
,
afraid
that
he
might
touch
it
,
moved
it
further
away

pointed
with
his

obviously
forgotten
who
was
standing
in

of
him

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
remained
quiet
,
turned
toward
the
machine
,
grabbed
one
of
the
brass
rods
,
and
then
,
leaning
back
a
little
,
looked
up
at
the
inscriber
,
as
if

was
checking

several
times
,

the

“on

pretty
brisk

grumbled

said
the

of

was
enough
,

he

said

his

fixed
and

expression

said
the
officer
and
looked
away
,
as
if
he
was
talking
to
himself
and
wished
not
to
embarrass
the
traveler
with
an
explanation
of

so
self-evident

said

smiled
at

said
the

sudden
question

his
friendly
expression
made
a

the

jim’s

good

me

kinder
thin
ice
,
but
i
says
:
“the
captain
see
me
standing
around
,
and
told
me
i
better
have
something
to
eat
before
i
went
ashore
;
so
he
took
me
in
the
texas
to
the
officers’
lunch
,
and
give
me
all
i
wanted
.

all
she
could
do
to
hold
in
;
and
her
eyes
snapped
,
and
her
fingers
worked
like
she
wanted
to
scratch
him
;
and
she
says
:
“who’s
‘everybody’
?

went
through
me
like
a
shot
,
and
i
thought
if
it
was
cairo
i
reckoned
i
would
die
of
miserableness
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

me
so
sick
i

fell
out
of
the
tree
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
shiver
.
|
|
|
|
jolted
her
up
like
everything
,
of
course
;
but
i
was
over
the
shoal
water
now
,
so
i
went
right
along
,
her
eyes
a-blazing
higher
and
higher
all
the
time
,
and
told
her
every
blame
thing
,
from
where
we
first
struck
that
young
fool
going
up
to
the
steamboat
,
clear
through
to
where
she
flung
herself
on
to
the
king’s
breast
at
the
front
door
and
he
kissed
her
sixteen
or
seventeen
times—and
then
up
she
jumps
,
with
her
face
afire
like
sunset
,
and
says
:
“the
brute
!

“but

said
the
officer
,

moved
up
right
next
to
the
traveler
in

with

“good

said
the
officer
,
at
least
partially
satisfied
.
|
|
|
|
|

she
says

in
spite
of
the
obvious
speed
with
which
he
took
off
the
coat
of
his
uniform
and
then
undressed
himself
completely
,
he
handled
each
piece
of
clothing
very
carefully
,
even
running
his
fingers
over
the
silver
braids
on
his
tunic
with
special
care
and
shaking
a
tassel
into

he
had
a
lot
of

done
other
wonderful
things
,
like
finding
water
and
gold
with
a
“divining-rod

“dissipating

on
the
ground
floor
of
one
of
the
houses
was
a
deep
,
low
room
,
like
a
cave
,
with
smoke-covered
walls
and
ceiling
.

‘bouts

they
pushed
one
of
the
tables
aside
,
under
which
there
was
a
real
grave
stone
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
talked
it
over
,
and
they
was
going
to
rule
me
out
,
because
they
said
every
boy
must
have
a
family
or
somebody
to
kill
,
or
else
it
wouldn’t
be
fair

square
for

stopped
pulling
.
|
|
to
listen
.
|
|
|
|
went
off
and
i
got
aboard
the
raft
,
feeling
bad
and
low
,
because
i
knowed
very
well
i
had
done
wrong
,
and
i
see
it
warn’t
no
use
for
me
to
try
to
learn
to
do
right
;
a
body
that
don’t
get
started
right
when
he’s
little
ain’t
got
no
show—when
the
pinch
comes
there
ain’t
nothing
to
back
him
up
and
keep
him
to
his
work
,
and
so
he
gets
beat

‘twas

all
laughed
,
and
bob
says
:
“why
,
buck
,
they
might
have
scalped
us
all
,
you’ve
been
so
slow
in
coming

shouted
,
and
was
starting
right
off
;
but
the
lawyer
and
the
doctor
sung
out
:
“hold
on
,
hold
on
!

|
|

|
|

marks
we’ll
lynch
the
whole
gang
!

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
done
it
,
and
soon
as
they
was
aboard
i
lit
out
for
our
towhead
,
and
in
about
five
or
ten
minutes
we
heard
the
dogs
and
the
men
away
off
,
shouting
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
give
a
glance
at
one
another
,
and
nodded
their
heads
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
“what
d’
i
tell
you
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
worried
over
that
awhile
,
and
ransacked
all
around
for
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
says
:
“there’s
several
;
but
it’s
the
proctors
,
mainly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
still
a
minute—thinking
;
then
the
king
says
,
kind
of
absent-minded
like
:
“mf
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
when
the
traveler
had
read
it
and
got
up
,
he
saw
the
men
standing
around
him
and
smiling
,
as
if
they
had
read
the
inscription
with
him
,
found
it
ridiculous
,
and
were
asking
him
to
share
their
opinion
.

|
|
i
lit
my
candle
and
went
up
to
my
room
that
night
there
sat
pap
his
own
self
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
daylight
,
here
was
the
clear
ohio
water
inshore
,
sure
enough
,
and
outside
was
the
old
regular
muddy
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
got
up-stairs
to
his
room
he
got
me
a
coarse
shirt
and
a
roundabout
and
pants
of
his
,
and
i
put
them
on
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
everybody
gethered
around
the
table
,
and
the
king
he
counted
it
and
stacked
it
up
,
three
hundred
dollars
in
a
pile—twenty
elegant
little
piles
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
the
house
the
street
in
front
of
it
was
packed
,
and
the
three
girls
was
standing
in
the
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
struck
the
boat
she
was
about
done
loading
,
and
pretty
soon
she
got
off
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
said
that
i
see
i
was
out
of
the
woods
again
,
and
so
i
was
comfortable
and
glad
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
heard
my
voice
it
righted
him
up
some
,
but
he
warn’t
quite
satisfied
yet
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
then
she
told
me
all
about
the
bad
place
,
and
i
said
i
wished
i
was
there
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
put
her
arm
around
the
king
on
one
side
,
and
susan
and
the
hare-lip
done
the
same
on
the
other
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
all
stuck
a
pin
in
their
fingers
to
get
blood
to
sign
with
,
and
i
made
my
mark
on
the
paper
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
wrote
something
on
a
paper
and
read
it
over
,
and
says
:
“there
;
you
see
it
says
‘for
a
consideration
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
down
on
all
fours
and
crawled
off
,
begging
them
to
let
him
alone
,
and
he
rolled
himself
up
in
his
blanket
and
wallowed
in
under
the
old
pine
table
,
still
a-begging
;
and
then
he
went
to
crying
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
dropped
down
and
went
to
sleep
again
;
but
what
he
had
been
saying
give
me
the
very
idea
i
wanted
.

up

the

right
along

pretty

the

hid
him

to

along
again
,
perfectly
ca’m
,
and
goes
to
dropping
in
his
funeral
orgies
again
every
now
and
then
,
just
like
he
done
before

down

begun
to
glide
along
the

,
just
his
shoulders
showing
over
the
people’s
heads
.

along

again
to
his
place
.

:

i
went
in
the
back
door—you
only
have
to
pull
a
buckskin
latch-string
,
they
don’t
fasten
the
doors—but
that
warn’t
romantical
enough
for

no

the

said
he
hoped

being
searched
for

he
didn’t

i
was
mighty
thankful
to
that

for
doing
jim
that
good
turn
;
and
i
was
glad
it
was
according
to
my
judgment
of
him
,
too
;
because
i
thought
he
had
a
good

there
was
a
racket

ripping

tearing

smashing

down

the

:

he
locked
the
door

barred
it
and
bolted
it
,
and
told
the
young
men
to
come
in
with
their
guns
,
and
they
all
went
in
a
big
parlor
that
had
a
new
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
,
and
got
together
in
a
corner

he’s
missed
seeing
his

peter
die—which
he
mayn’t

nobody
can
tell
as
to
that—but
his

he
died

never
talked
about
nothing
else

three

hadn’t

him
since
they
was

together—and
hadn’t

being

there
was
going

then
the
nigger
come
back
,
and
we
said
we’d
come
again
some
time
if
the
nigger
wanted
us
to
;
and
he
said
he
would
,
more
particular
if
it
was
dark
,
because
the
witches
went
for

in

around

how
good

was

what

he
was

all
that

before

a

iron-jawed

worked
himself
in
there
from

stood
a-listening
and
looking
,
and
not
saying
anything
;
and
nobody
saying
anything

the

at

period
just

advent

bartleby
,
i
had
two
persons
as

when
things
began
to
come

me
they
seemed
to
come
up
dim
out
of
last

turkey
was
a
short
,
pursy
englishman
of
about
my
own
age
,
that
is
,
somewhere
not
far
from
sixty
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sat
glowing
like
a
brass
boiler
,
his
bald
head
steaming
,
his
hands
reeling
among
his
blotted
papers
.
|
|

|
|
indeed
,
not
only
would
he
be
reckless
and
sadly
given
to
making
blots
in
the
afternoon
,
but
some
days
he
went
further
,
and
was
rather
noisy
.

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
this
quick-witted
youth
the
whole
noble
science
of
the
law
was
contained
in
a
nut-shell
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
his
wonderful
mildness
chiefly
,
which
not
only
disarmed
me
,
but
unmanned
me
,
as
it
were
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

i
was
aware
that
not
only
was
he
,
at
times
,
considerable
of
a
ward-politician
,
but
he
occasionally
did
a
little
business
at
the
justices’
courts
,
and
was
not
unknown
on
the
steps
of
the
tombs
.

|
will
.
|
|
|
he
wouldn’t
.
|
|
|
|
nevertheless
,
as
he
was
in
many
ways
a
most
valuable
person
to
me
,
and
all
the
time
before
twelve
o’clock
,
meridian
,
was
the
quickest
,
steadiest
creature
too
,
accomplishing
a
great
deal
of
work
in
a
style
not
easy
to
be
matched—for
these
reasons
,
i
was
willing
to
overlook
his
eccentricities
,
though
indeed
,
occasionally
,
i
remonstrated
with
him
.

|
|
next
morning
,
upon
awakening
,
i
had
my
doubts
,—i
had
somehow
slept
off
the
fumes
of
vanity
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
turn
everything
off

“with
submission
,
sir
,”
said
turkey
on
this
occasion
,
“i
consider
myself

right-hand
man

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

”—and
he
made
a
violent
thrust
with
the
ruler
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
was
gone
.
|
|
|
|
the
duke
went
for
him
.

“but

intimated
i
.

“true

,

nippers
,
the
second
on
my
list
,
was
a
whiskered
,
sallow
,
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
rather
piratical-looking
young
man
of
about
five
and
twenty
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
added
to
this
,
he
always
dressed
in
a
gentlemanly
sort
of
way
;
and
so
,
incidentally
,
reflected
credit
upon
my
chambers
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
whereas
with
respect
to
turkey
,
i
had
much
ado
to
keep
him
from
being
a
reproach
to
me
.

though
concerning
the
self-indulgent
habits
of
turkey
i
had
my
own
private
surmises
,
yet
touching
nippers
i
was
well
persuaded
that
whatever
might
be
his
faults
in
other
respects
,
he
was
,
at
least
,
a
temperate
young
man
.

it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
,
owing
to
its
peculiar
cause—indigestion—the
irritability
and
consequent
nervousness
of
nippers

morning

in

afternoon
he
was
comparatively
mild

copying
law
papers
being
proverbially
a
dry
,
husky
sort
of
business
,
my
two
scriveners
were
fain
to
moisten
their
mouths
very
often
with
spitzenbergs
to
be
had
at
the
numerous
stalls
nigh
the
custom
house
and
post
office
.

after
a
few
words
touching
his
qualifications
,
i
engaged
him
,
glad
to
have
among
my
corps
of
copyists
a
man
of
so
singularly
sedate
an
aspect
,
which
i
thought
might
operate
beneficially
upon
the
flighty
temper
of
turkey
,
and
the
fiery
one
of
nippers
.

i
should
have
stated
before
that
ground
glass
folding-doors
divided
my
premises
into
two
parts
,
one
of
which
was
occupied
by
my
scriveners
,
the
other
by
myself
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|

|
|
|
|
within
three
feet
of
the
panes
was
a
wall
,
and
the
light
came
down
from
far
above
,
between
two
lofty
buildings
,
as
from
a
very
small
opening
in
a
dome
.
|

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
still
further
to
a
satisfactory
arrangement
,
i
procured
a
high
green
folding
screen
,
which
might
entirely
isolate
bartleby
from
my
sight
,
though
not
remove
him
from
my
voice
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
with
the
soldier
and
the
condemned
man
looking
at
him
,
he
hesitated
a
moment
.

it
is
,
of
course
,
an
indispensable
part
of
a
scrivener’s
business
to
verify
the
accuracy
of
his
copy
,
word
by
word
.

now
and
then
,
in
the
haste
of
business
,
it
had
been
my
habit
to
assist
in
comparing
some
brief
document
myself
,
calling
turkey
or
nippers
for
this
purpose
.

in
this
very
attitude
did
i
sit
when
i
called
to
him
,
rapidly
stating
what
it
was
i
wanted
him
to
do—namely
,
to
examine
a
small
paper
with
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|
imagine
my
surprise
,
nay
,
my
consternation
,
when
without
moving
from
his
privacy
,
bartleby
in
a
singularly
mild
,
firm
voice
,
replied
,
“i
would
prefer
not
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|
|
|
|
“what
do
you
mean
?
|
|
|
|
word
,
sir
?
|
|
|
|
got
you
into
trouble
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
23
“i
would
prefer
not
to
,”
said
he
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
24
i
looked
at
him
steadfastly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
25
a
few
days
after
this
,
bartleby
concluded
four
lengthy
documents
,
being
quadruplicates
of
a
week’s
testimony
taken
before
me
in
my
high
court
of
chancery
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
accordingly
turkey
,
nippers
and
ginger
nut
had
taken
their
seats
in
a
row
,
each
with
his
document
in
hand
,
when
i
called
to
bartleby
to
join
this
interesting
group
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
,
if
any
disinterested
persons
are
present
,
he
turns
to
them
for
some
reinforcement
for
his
own
faltering
mind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
26
“bartleby
!
|
|
|
quick
,
i
am
waiting
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
28
“what
is
wanted
?
|
|
|
|
|
29
“the
copies
,
the
copies
,”
said
i
hurriedly
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
“we
are
going
to
examine
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
can
get
along
with
it
,
too
,”
he
says
;
“just
you
slide
down
cellar
and
fetch
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there”—and
i
held
towards
him
the
fourth
quadruplicate
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
30
“i
would
prefer
not
to
,”
he
said
,
and
gently
disappeared
behind
the
screen
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
31
for
a
few
moments
i
was
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
,
standing
at
the
head
of
my
seated
column
of
clerks
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
recovering
myself
,
i
advanced
towards
the
screen
,
and
demanded
the
reason
for
such
extraordinary
conduct
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
32
“why
do
you
refuse
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
35
“these
are
your
own
copies
we
are
about
to
examine

it’ll
be
the
better
for
you

|
|
|

|
|
|
,
or
i’ll
shoot
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
37
“you
are
decided
,
then
,
not
to
comply
with
my
request—a
request
made
according
to
common
usage
and
common
sense

it
is
not
seldom
the
case
that
when
a
man
is
browbeaten
in
some
unprecedented
and
violently
unreasonable
way
,
he
begins
to
stagger
in
his
own
plainest
faith

willing

it

pretty
bad

maybe
the
hair-ball
would
take
it

so
on

“you
hear

meanwhile
bartleby
sat
in
his
hermitage
,
oblivious
to
every
thing

his
own
peculiar
business
there

he
lives
,
then
,
on
ginger-nuts
,
thought
i
;
never
eats
a
dinner
,
properly
speaking
;
he
must
be
a
vegetarian
then
;
but
no
;
he
never
eats
even
vegetables
,
he
eats
nothing

ginger-nuts

ginger-nuts
are
so
called
because
they
contain
ginger
as
one
of
their
peculiar
constituents
,
and
the
final
flavoring
one
.

ginger

had
no

52
nothing
so
aggravates
an
earnest
person
as
a
passive
resistance
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
thought
i
,
he
means
no
mischief
;
it
is
plain
he
intends
no
insolence

his

sufficiently
evinces
that
his
eccentricities
are
involuntary

i
threw
open
the
folding-doors
near

and
turning
upon
turkey
and
nippers
,
exclaimed
in
an
excited
manner—
58

77
“bartleby

78
like

“very

said
i
,
in
a
quiet
sort
of
serenely
severe
self-possessed
tone

intimating
the
unalterable

now
,
one
sunday
morning
i
happened
to
go
to
trinity
church
,
to
hear
a
celebrated
preacher
,
and
finding
myself
rather
early
on
the
ground
,
i
thought
i
would
walk
round
to
my
chambers
for
a
while
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
quite
surprised
,
i
called
out
;
when
to
my
consternation
a
key
was
turned
from
within
;
and
thrusting
his
lean
visage
at
me
,
and
holding
the
door
ajar
,
the
apparition
of
bartleby
appeared
,
in
his
shirt
sleeves
,
and
otherwise
in
a
strangely
tattered
dishabille
,
saying
quietly
that
he
was
sorry
,
but
he
was
deeply
engaged
just
then
,
and—preferred
not
admitting
me
at
present
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
fortune
for
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
86
now
,
the
utterly
unsurmised
appearance
of
bartleby
,
tenanting
my
law-chambers
of
a
sunday
morning
,
with
his
cadaverously
gentlemanly
nonchalance
,
yet
withal
firm
and
self-possessed
,
had
such
a
strange
effect
upon
me
,
that
incontinently
i
slunk
away
from
my
own
door
,
and
did
as
desired
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
furthermore
,
i
was
full
of
uneasiness
as
to
what
bartleby
could
possibly
be
doing
in
my
office
in
his
shirt
sleeves
,
and
in
an
otherwise
dismantled
condition
of
a
sunday
morning
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nay
,
that
was
out
of
the
question
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
again
,
whatever
might
be
his
eccentricities
,
bartleby
was
an
eminently
decorous
person
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
—copying
?
|
|
87
nevertheless
,
my
mind
was
not
pacified
;
and
full
of
a
restless
curiosity
,
at
last
i
returned
to
the
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
rolled
away
under
his
desk
,
i
found
a
blanket
;
under
the
empty
grate
,
a
blacking
box
and
brush
;
on
a
chair
,
a
tin
basin
,
with
soap
and
a
ragged
towel
;
in
a
newspaper
a
few
crumbs
of
ginger-nuts
and
a
morsel
of
cheese
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
88
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
feeling
of
overpowering
stinging
melancholy
seized
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
presentiments
of
strange
discoveries
hovered
round
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
89
suddenly
i
was
attracted
by
bartleby’s
closed
desk
,
the
key
in
open
sight
left
in
the
lock
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
90
i
mean
no
mischief
,
seek
the
gratification
of
no
heartless
curiosity
,
thought
i
;
besides
,
the
desk
is
mine
,
and
its
contents
too
,
so
i
will
make
bold
to
look
within
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
presently
i
felt
something
there
,
and
dragged
it
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
91
i
now
recalled
all
the
quiet
mysteries
which
i
had
noted
in
the
man
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
—of
pallid
haughtiness
,
say
,
or
rather
an
austere
reserve
about
him
,
which
had
positively
awed
me
into
my
tame
compliance
with
his
eccentricities
,
when
i
had
feared
to
ask
him
to
do
the
slightest
incidental
thing
for
me
,
even
though
i
might
know
,
from
his
long-continued
motionlessness
,
that
behind
his
screen
he
must
be
standing
in
one
of
those
dead-wall
reveries
of
his
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
92
revolving
all
these
things
,
and
coupling
them
with
the
recently
discovered
fact
that
he
made
my
office
his
constant
abiding
place
and
home
,
and
not
forgetful
of
his
morbid
moodiness
;
revolving
all
these
things
,
a
prudential
feeling
began
to
steal
over
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
93
i
did
not
accomplish
the
purpose
of
going
to
trinity
church
that
morning
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
somehow
,
the
things
i
had
seen
disqualified
me
for
the
time
from
church-going
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
94
the
next
morning
came
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
95
“bartleby
,”
said
i
,
gently
calling
to
him
behind
his
screen
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
96
no
reply
.
|
|
|
|
97
“bartleby
,”
said
i
,
in
a
still
gentler
tone
,
“come
here
;
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
to
do
any
thing
you
would
prefer
not
to
do—i
simply
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
99
“will
you
tell
me
,
bartleby
,
where
you
were
born
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
105
“what
is
your
answer
,
bartleby
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
106
“at
present
i
prefer
to
give
no
answer
,”
he
said
,
and
retired
into
his
hermitage
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
107
it
was
rather
weak
in
me
i
confess
,
but
his
manner
on
this
occasion
nettled
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
108
again
i
sat
ruminating
what
i
should
do
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mortified
as
i
was
at
his
behavior
,
and
resolved
as
i
had
been
to
dismiss
him
when
i
entered
my
office
,
nevertheless
i
strangely
felt
something
superstitious
knocking
at
my
heart
,
and
forbidding
me
to
carry
out
my
purpose
,
and
denouncing
me
for
a
villain
if
i
dared
to
breathe
one
bitter
word
against
this
forlornest
of
mankind
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
110
just
then
the
folding-doors
opened
,
and
nippers
approached
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
111
“prefer
not
,
eh
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
113
“mr
.
|
|
|
nippers
,”
said
i
,
“i’d
prefer
that
you
would
withdraw
for
the
present
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
115
as
nippers
,
looking
very
sour
and
sulky
,
was
departing
,
turkey
blandly
and
deferentially
approached
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
116
“with
submission
,
sir
,”
said
he
,
“yesterday
i
was
thinking
about
bartleby
here
,
and
i
think
that
if
he
would
but
prefer
to
take
a
quart
of
good
ale
every
day
,
it
would
do
much
towards
mending
him
,
and
enabling
him
to
assist
in
examining
his
papers
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
118
“with
submission
,
what
word
,
sir
,”
asked
turkey
,
respectfully
crowding
himself
into
the
contracted
space
behind
the
screen
,
and
by
so
doing
,
making
me
jostle
the
scrivener
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
120
“that’s
the
word
,
turkey
,”
said
i—“that’s
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
125
the
next
day
i
noticed
that
bartleby
did
nothing
but
stand
at
his
window
in
his
dead-wall
revery
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
126
“why
,
how
now
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
130
i
looked
steadfastly
at
him
,
and
perceived
that
his
eyes
looked
dull
and
glazed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
instantly
it
occurred
to
me
,
that
his
unexampled
diligence
in
copying
by
his
dim
window
for
the
first
few
weeks
of
his
stay
with
me
might
have
temporarily
impaired
his
vision
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
both
men
,
the
soldier
and
the
condemned
man
,
ran
in
front
of
him
and
with
hands
outstretched
pointed
to
the
place
where
the
grave
was
located
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
131
i
was
touched
.
|
|
|
|
|
132
still
added
days
went
by
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
whether
bartleby’s
eyes
improved
or
not
,
i
could
not
say
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
133
“what
!
|
|
|
135
he
remained
as
ever
,
a
fixture
in
my
chamber
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
nay—if
that
were
possible—he
became
still
more
of
a
fixture
than
before
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
decently
as
i
could
,
i
told
bartleby
that
in
six
days’
time
he
must
unconditionally
leave
the
office
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
“and
when
you
finally
quit
me
,
bartleby
,”
added
i
,
“i
shall
see
that
you
go
not
away
entirely
unprovided
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
to
you
,
this
should
not
be
so
vile
a
place
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
jim
?
|
|
|
137
i
buttoned
up
my
coat
,
balanced
myself
;
advanced
slowly
towards
him
,
touched
his
shoulder
,
and
said
,
“the
time
has
come
;
you
must
quit
this
place
;
i
am
sorry
for
you
;
here
is
money
;
but
you
must
go
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
139
“you
must
.
|
|
|
|
141
now
i
had
an
unbounded
confidence
in
this
man’s
common
honesty
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
142
“bartleby
,”
said
i
,
“i
owe
you
twelve
dollars
on
account
;
here
are
thirty-two
;
the
odd
twenty
are
yours
.

|
|
|
|
|
—will
you
take
it
?
|
|
|
?
|
|
|
143
but
he
made
no
motion
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
144
“i
will
leave
them
here
then
,”
putting
them
under
a
weight
on
the
table
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
146
as
i
walked
home
in
a
pensive
mood
,
my
vanity
got
the
better
of
my
pity
.
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
masterly
i
call
it
,
and
such
it
must
appear
to
any
dispassionate
thinker
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
147
after
breakfast
,
i
walked
down
town
,
arguing
the
probabilities
pro
and
con
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
148
“i’ll
take
odds
he
doesn’t

said
a
voice
as
i
passed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

i
was
earlier

at

i
was
thunderstruck

154
“not

turn
the
man
out
by
an
actual
thrusting
i
could
not
;
to
drive
him
away
by
calling
him
hard
names
would
not
do
;
calling
in
the
police
was
an
unpleasant
idea
;
and
yet
,
permit
him
to
enjoy
his
cadaverous
triumph

me

“bartleby

said
i
,
entering
the
office
,
with
a
quietly
severe
expression
,
“i
am
seriously
displeased
.
|

he
answered
nothing
.
|

157
“will
you
,

will
you
not

quit
me
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
158
“i
would
prefer
not
to
quit
you
,”
he
replied
,
gently
emphasizing
the
not
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

159
“what
earthly
right
have
you
to
stay
here

you

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
163
i
was
now
in
such
a
state
of
nervous
resentment
that
i
thought
it
but
prudent
to
check
myself
at
present
from
further
demonstrations
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|

|

often
it
had
occurred
to
me
in
my
ponderings
upon
the
subject
,
that
had
that
altercation
taken
place
in
the
public
street
,
or
at
a
private
residence
,
it
would
not
have
terminated
as
it
did
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
crouched
down
there
with
two
small
children
in
my
arms
,
on
my
right
and
left
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
do
that
and
try
to
see
how
close
they
can
come
without
touching
;
sometimes
the
wheel
bites
off
a
sweep
,
and
then
the
pilot
sticks
his
head
out
and
laughs
,
and
thinks
he’s
mighty
smart
.

but
when
this
old
adam
of
resentment
rose
in
me
and
tempted
me
concerning
bartleby
,
i
grappled
him
and
threw
him
.

aside
from
higher
considerations
,
charity
often
operates
as
a
vastly
wise
and
prudent
principle—a
great
safeguard
to
its
possessor
.

,
and
anger’s
sake
,

,
and
spiritual
pride’s

;
but
no
man
that

i
endeavored
also
immediately
to
occupy
myself
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
comfort
my
despondency

half-past

o’clock
came
;
turkey
began
to
glow
in

face
,
overturn
his
inkstand
,
and
become
generally
obstreperous
;
nippers
abated
down
into
quietude
and
courtesy
;
ginger
nut
munched
his
noon
apple
;
and
bartleby
remained
standing
at
his
window
in
one
of
his
profoundest
dead-wall
reveries
.

some
days
now
passed
,
during
which
,
at
leisure
intervals
i
looked
a
little
into
“edwards

the
will
,”
and
“priestley
on
necessity
.

i
believe
that
this
wise
and
blessed
frame
of
mind
would
have
continued
with
me
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
unsolicited
and
uncharitable
remarks
obtruded
upon
me
by
my
professional
friends
who
visited
the
rooms
.

also
,
when
a
reference
was
going
on
,
and
the
room
full
of
lawyers
and
witnesses
and
business
was
driving
fast
;
some
deeply
occupied
legal
gentleman
present
,
seeing
bartleby
wholly
unemployed
,
would
request
him
to
run
round
to
his
(the
legal
gentleman’s)
office
and
fetch
some
papers
for
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

thereupon
,
bartleby
would
tranquilly
decline
,
and
yet
remain
idle
as
before
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
169
ere
revolving
any
complicated
project
,
however
,
adapted
to
this
end
,
i
first
simply
suggested
to
bartleby
the
propriety
of
his
permanent
departure
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
170
what
shall
i
do
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
rid
myself
of
him
,
i
must
;
go
,
he
shall
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
bribes
he
leaves
under
your
own
paperweight
on
your
table
;
in
short
,
it
is
quite
plain
that
he
prefers
to
cling
to
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
171
then
something
severe
,
something
unusual
must
be
done
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
—a
vagrant
,
is
he
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
wrong
again
:
for
indubitably
he
does
support
himself
,
and
that
is
the
only
unanswerable
proof
that
any
man
can
show
of
his
possessing
the
means
so
to
do
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
since
he
will
not
quit
me
,
i
must
quit
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
172
acting
accordingly
,
next
day
i
thus
addressed
him
:
“i
find
these
chambers
too
far
from
the
city
hall
;
the
air
is
unwholesome
.
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
174
on
the
appointed
day
i
engaged
carts
and
men
,
proceeded
to
my
chambers
,
and
having
but
little
furniture
,
every
thing
was
removed
in
a
few
hours
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
throughout
,
the
scrivener
remained
standing
behind
the
screen
,
which
i
directed
to
be
removed
the
last
thing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
175
i
re-entered
,
with
my
hand
in
my
pocket—and—and
my
heart
in
my
mouth
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
176
“good-bye
,
bartleby
;
i
am
going—good-bye
,
and
god
some
way
bless
you
;
and
take
that
,”
slipping
something
in
his
hand
.

established
in
my
new
quarters
,
for
a
day
or
two
i
kept
the
door
locked
,
and
started
at
every
footfall
in
the
passages
.

|
|

|
|

178
i
thought
all
was
going
well
,
when
a
perturbed
looking
stranger
visited
me
,
inquiring
whether
i
was
the
person
who
had
recently
occupied
rooms
at
no
.

full
of
forebodings
,
i
replied
that
i
was
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
180
“then
sir
,”
said
the
stranger
,
who
proved
a
lawyer
,
“you
are
responsible
for
the
man
you
left
there

employed
him
as

he
has
done
nothing

time

all
is
over
with
him
,
by
this
time

i
at

,
when
through
another
week
no
further
intelligence
reached

“that’s
the
man—here
he
comes
,”
cried
the
foremost
one
,
whom
i
recognized
as
the
lawyer
who
had
previously
called
upon
me
alone

take
him
away
,
sir

at
once

cried
a
portly
person
among
them
,
advancing
upon
me
,

whom
i
knew
to
be
the
landlord

the
traveler
said

questions

expected

pointing
to
the

turned
him
out

now
persists
in
haunting

building

fearful
then
of
being
exposed
in
the
papers
(as
one
person
present
obscurely
threatened)
i
considered
the
matter
,

at
length
said

lawyer
would
give
me
a
confidential
interview
with
the
scrivener

in
his
(the

own

going
up
stairs
to
my
old
haunt

there
was
bartleby
silently
sitting
upon
the
banister
at
the
landing

he
mildly
replied

i
motioned
him
into

“bartleby

said
i
,
in
the
kindest
tone
i
could
assume
under
such
exciting
circumstances
,
“will

the
poor
scrivener
,
when
told
that
he
must
be
conducted
to
the
tombs

offered
not

bystanders
joined

a

what
makes
me
so
late
.

|
|
|
|
the
beatenest
thing
i
ever
struck
.

way
they’re
raised
.
|
|
|
they
always
do
.
|
|
|
all
do
.
|
|
|
|
they’ve
acted
from
the
very
start—left
us
to
do
everything
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
best
way
,
in
the
long
run
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
most
dazzling
idea
‘at
ever
a
man
struck
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gift
of
him
that
lays
yonder
,
cold
but
joyful
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
worst
imitation
i
ever
heard
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
only
saying
,
do
you
know
how
to
talk
french
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
too
good
for
true

it’s
too
good
for
true
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
the—the—gentlemen
,
if
you’ll
only
pull
ahead
,
and
let
me
heave
you
the
headline
,
you
won’t
have
to
come
a-near
the
raft—please
do
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
just
as
easy
.
|
|
|
like
the
way
it
was
with
the
niggers—it
warn’t
no
sale
,
and
the
niggers
will
be
back
before
long
.

i
should
suffer—perfectly
right—i
don’t
make
any
moan

|
|
jest
a
small
,
thin
,
blue
arrow—that’s
what
it
is
;
and
if
you
don’t
look
clost
,
you
can’t
see
it

as
mild

gaudy

because
they’re

take
it—won’t
you
?

say
it’s

what
if
it
is
?

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

unfortunately
replacement

are
difficult

come
by
in

come

they’re
invited
here

tomorrow
we
want
all
to
come—everybody
;
for
he
respected
everybody
,
he
liked
everybody
,

so
it’s
fitten
that
his
funeral
orgies
sh’d
be
public

certainly
not
a
difficult
duty—and
it’s
necessary

he
is

remain
fresh

all

perfectly
satisfactory

enough

what
the
man’s
face
seemed
to
be
asking
.
|

|
|
|
|
she
done
.
|
|

it
starts
with
.
|
|
|
|
|
the
correct
idea
.
|
|
|
whole
yarn—what’s
yourn
?
|
|
|
|
kind
of
a
bug
henry
was
;
and
if
we’d
a
had
him
along
‘stead
of
our
kings
he’d
a
fooled
that
town
a
heap
worse
than
ourn
done

|

.
|
|
one
which
the
prisoner
has
to
scrabble
on
the
wall
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
frenchman’s
way
of
saying
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
where
he
was
!
|
|
|
|
only
in
the
summer
time
,
when
he
comes
there
to
take
the
sea
baths
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
mighty
good
!
|
|
|
just
the
way
:
a
person
does
a
low-down
thing
,
and
then
he
don’t
want
to
take
no
consequences
of
it
.

|
|

|
|

|
|
|

wher
‘tis
.
|
|
|

i’ll
get
around
to
mentioning
its
purpose
in
a
moment
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
use
a
chain—even
though
that
will
affect
the
sensitivity
of
the
movements
for
the
right
arm
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
stand
up
and
report
on
today’s
execution
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
take
over
all
further
details
,
and
,
believe
me
,
if
my
speech
doesn’t
chase
him
out
of
the
room
,
it
will
force
him
to
his
knees
,
so
he’ll
have
to
admit
it
:
‘old
commandant
,
i
bow
down
before
you
.

we

we
lit
the

dangled
our
legs
in

talked
about
all

was
always
naked

day

night
,
whenever
the
mosquitoes
would
let
us—the
new
clothes
buck’s

discussions
are
already
taking
place
in
the
commandant’s
headquarters
,
to
which
i
am
not
invited
.
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|

|
|
|
|
early
in
the
morning
the
commandant
appeared
with
his
women
.

tomorrow
morning
i
leave
,
or
at
least
i
go
on
board
ship
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fanfares
woke
up
the
entire
campsite
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
naturally
,
i
was
always
allowed
to
stand
close
by
,
because
of
my
official
position
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
will
completely
misunderstand
the
issue
and
interpret
it
in
his
own
way
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
impatiently
he
looked
away
over
the
officer’s
head
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
back
then
we
had
to
erect
a
strong
railing
around
the
pit
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
although
his
power
might
be
sufficiently
great
to
take
action
against
me
,
he
doesn’t
yet
dare
to
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
they
couldn’t
understand
a
thing
,
they
stopped
eating
and
looked
over
at
the
traveler
,
still
chewing
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
there
was
little
difference
between
the
tea
house
and
the
rest
of
the
houses
in
the
colony
,
which
were
all
very
dilapidated
,
except
for
the
commandant’s
palatial
structure
,
the
traveler
was
struck
by
the
impression
of
historical
memory
,
and
he
felt
the
power
of
earlier
times
.

|
|
|
|
|
i’m
certain
he
will
use
all
his
shrewdness
to
interrogate
you
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
not
asking
you
to
lie
,
not
at
all
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
compelled
to
take
part
in
the
discussions
,
though
they
fill
me
with
disgust
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
one
of
them—but
i
hain’t
talked
it
around
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
for
killin’
him—and
didn’t
he
kill
old
hatfield
jist
the
same
way—and
don’t
he
deserve
it
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
putting
him
out
of
his
troubles
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
knocking
off
and
lighting
out
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
unfavorable
to
killin’
a
man
as
long
as
you
can
git
aroun’
it
;
it
ain’t
good
sense
,
it
ain’t
good
morals
.

“how
can
i
do
that
,”
he
cried
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
unless
someone
asks
you
directly
,
you
should
not
express
any
view
whatsoever
.

|
|
tomorrow
a
large
meeting
of
all
the
higher
administrative
officials
takes
place
at
headquarters
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
commandant
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
really
briefly—just
the
report
.
|
|
|
|
|
‘the
report
of
the
execution
,’
he’ll
say
,
or
something
like
that
,
‘has
just
been
given
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
place
your
hands
where
everyone
can
see
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
lean
over
the
railing
and
shout
it
out—yes
,
yes
,
roar
your
opinion
at
the
commandant
,
your
unshakeable
opinion
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
whisper
them
so
that
only
the
officials
underneath
you
can
just
hear
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
basically
he
was
honest
and
unafraid
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
“would
you
like
an
explanation
,”
asked
the
traveler
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
“even
before
you
took
me
into
your
confidence—and
,
of
course
,
i
will
never
abuse
your
confidence
under
any
circumstances—i
was
already
thinking
about
whether
i
was
entitled
to
intervene
against
this
procedure
and
whether
my
intervention
could
have
the
smallest
chance
of
success
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
“well
then
,
it’s
time
,”
he
said
finally
and
suddenly
looked
at
the
traveler
with
bright
eyes
which
contained
some
sort
of
demand
,
some
appeal
for
participation
.
|
|

|
|

up
de

en
went
‘bout
two
mile
er
more

he
says
.
|
|
|
|
|
i’d
been
selling
an
article
to
take
the
tartar
off
the
teeth—and
it
does
take
it
off
,
too
,
and
generly
the
enamel
along
with
it—but
i
stayed
about
one
night
longer
than
i
ought
to
,
and
was
just
in
the
act
of
sliding
out
when
i
ran
across
you
on
the
trail
this
side
of
town
,
and
you
told
me
they
were
coming
,
and
begged
me
to
help
you
to
get
off

ben
a-running’
a
little
temperance
revival
thar
‘bout
a
week
,
and
was
the
pet
of
the
women
folks
,
big
and
little
,
for
i
was
makin’
it
mighty
warm
for
the
rummies

i
tell
you

and
takin’
as
much
as
five
or
six
dollars
a
night—ten
cents
a
head
,
children
and
niggers
free—and
business
a-growin’
all
the
time
,
when
somehow
or
another
a
little
report
got
around
last
night
that
i
had
a
way
of
puttin’
in

time
with

he
says
,
“if
they’d
a
ben
some
,
i
reckon
i’d
a
got
one
.
|

“when

doggery
yesterday
i
says
to
myself
,
we
can’t
get
him
home
for
hours
,
till
he’s
soberer
;
so
i
went
a-loafing
around
town
to
put
in
the
time
and
wait

“time

“you’re
tearing

cried
the
officer

“be
still
!

|
we’ll
undo
them
right
away

|
|
|
|
keep
them
till
they’re
ransomed
to
death
;
and
a
bothersome
lot
they’ll
be
,
too—eating
up
everything
,

always
trying

loose

it
alone
for
to-day

course
we
don’t

to
go
by
that
town
yonder
in
daylight—it
mightn’t

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|

take
these
fellows
to
the
tavern
and
affront
them
with
t’other
couple
,
and
i
reckon
we’ll
find
out
something
before
we
get
through
.

dig
him
out

send
you
some
things
by
them
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
fetch
a
rock
.
|
|
|
you
a
little
one
and
you
plant
it
in
the
corner
over
there
,
and
raise
it
.

|
|
|
|
|

use

both

|
|
|
|
do
that
,
too
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
“pull
him
out
,”
the
officer
ordered
the
soldier
.
|

“i’ve
already
told
you
i
can’t

“‘be

‘be

“that

said
the
traveler
.

|
|
|
|

|
“here
you
have
your
handkerchiefs
,”
he
said
and
threw
them
over
to
the
condemned
man

|
|

|
|

“go
home
,”
he
said
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
obviously
the
machine
was
breaking
up
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
“help
,”
the
traveler
yelled
out
to
the
soldier
and
the
condemned
man
and
grabbed
the
officer’s
feet
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
followed
by
his
companions
,
he
walked
closer
,
going
between
the
unoccupied
tables
,
which
stood
in
the
street
in
front
of
the
tea
house
,
and
took
a
breath
of
the
cool
,
stuffy
air
which
came
from
inside
.

none
of
them
wore
coats
,
and
their
shirts
were
torn
.
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
the
humming
hidden
energy
of
machines
waiting
to
function
at
the
tap
of
a
button
.

family
couldn’t
before
they
died
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
similarly
,
behind
them
,
in
the
halls
,
lights
went
on
and
off
as
they
left
them
behind
,
with
a
soft
automaticity
.

it’s
a
trial
that’s
sweetened
and
sanctified
to
us
by
this
dear
sympathy
and
these
holy
tears
,
and
so
he
thanks
them
out
of
his
heart
and
out
of
his
brother’s
heart
,
because
out
of
their
mouths
they
can’t
,
words
being
too
weak
and
cold
,
and
all
that
kind
of
rot
and
slush
,
till
it
was
just
sickening
;
and
then
he
blubbers
out
a
pious
goody-goody
amen
,
and
turns
himself
loose
and
goes
to
crying
fit
to
bust
.

splendid
young
man
come
galloping
down
the
road
,
setting
his
horse
easy
and
looking
like
a
soldier
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
i
heard
a
twig
snap
down
in
the
dark
amongst
the
trees—something
was
a
stirring
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
made
it
out
.
|
|
|
|
found
a
man
out
in
the
river
with
a
skiff
,
setting
a
trot-line
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
out
on
the
road
,
trying
to
think
what
i
better
do
,
and
i
run
across
a
boy
walking
,
and
asked
him
if
he’d
seen
a
strange
nigger
dressed
so
and
so
,
and
he
says
:
“yes
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
jim
says
:
“say
,
who
is
you
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
he
was
all
fagged
out
,
and
fell
down
panting
;
then
he
rolled
over
and
over
wonderful
fast
,
kicking
things
every
which
way
,
and
striking
and
grabbing
at
the
air
with
his
hands
,
and
screaming
and
saying
there
was
devils
a-hold
of
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tired
out
,
and
dropped
down
with
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
said
he
would
rest
a
minute
and
then
kill
me
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
gapped
and
stretched
himself
and
hove
off
the
blanket
,
and
it
was
miss
watson’s
jim
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
begun
to
speak
,
and
i
see
straight
off
he
pronounced
like
an
englishman—not
the
king’s
way
,
though
the
king’s
was
pretty
good
for
an
imitation
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
sighs
and
shakes
his
head
;
then
sighs
again
,
and
says
:
“no
,
it
wouldn’t
do—there
ain’t
necessity
enough
for
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
darkened
up
,
and
begun
to
thunder
and
lighten
;
so
the
birds
was
right
about
it
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
she
says
,
“what
did
you
say
your
name
was
,
honey
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
made
the
cold
chills
streak
all
down
my
back
,
because
she
says
:
“but
here
we’re
a-running
on
this
way
,
and
you
hain’t
told
me
a
word
about
sis
,
nor
any
of
them
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
we
struck
the
forward
end
of
the
skylight
,
and
clumb
on
to
it
;
and
the
next
step
fetched
us
in
front
of
the
captain’s
door
,
which
was
open
,
and
by
jimminy
,
away
down
through
the
texas-hall
we
see
a
light
!

come
to
a
nice
innocent-looking
young
country
jake
setting
on
a
log
swabbing
the
sweat
off
of
his
face
,
for
it
was
powerful
warm
weather
;
and
he
had
a
couple
of
big
carpet-bags
by
him
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
,
and
the
noise
of
the
tramping
was
like
a
soldier
march
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
tom
says
:
“ready
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
directly
i
could
just
barely
hear
a
“me-yow
!
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
begun
to
rain
,
and
it
rained
like
all
fury
,
too
,
and
i
never
see
the
wind
blow
so
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
me-yow
!
|
|
says
i
,
“me-yow
!
|
|
for
two
cents
i’d
leave
the
blamed
country
and
never
come
a-near
it
agin
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
if
it
could
stay
where
it
is
,
all
right
;
because
when
we
get
down
the
river
a
hundred
mile
or
two
i
could
write
back
to
mary
jane
,
and
she
could
dig
him
up
again
and
get
it
;
but
that
ain’t
the
thing
that’s
going
to
happen
;
the
thing
that’s
going
to
happen
is
,
the
money
‘ll
be
found
when
they
come
to
screw
on
the
lid
.

is

i
can
explain
better
how
we
come
to
not

in
that
room
this
morning
if
i
go
out
to
one
side

study

:

tom
he
made
a
sign
to
me—kind
of
a
little
noise
with
his
mouth—and
we
went
creeping
away
on
our
hands
and
knees
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
went
to
the
soap-kettle
and
searched
around
,
and
fetched
back
the
iron
thing
they
lift
the
lid
with
;
so
he
took
it
and
prized
out
one
of
the
staples
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
down
the
lightning-rod
to
spy
around
;
and
the
nigger
at
the
back
door
was
asleep
,
and
he
stuck
it
in
the
back
of
his
neck
and
come
back
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
looked
at
the
nigger
,
steady
and
kind
of
wondering
,
and
says
:
“does
who
know
us
?
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
said
he
slipped
jim’s
hat
off
of
his
head
and
hung
it
on
a
limb
right
over
him
,
and
jim
stirred
a
little
,
but
he
didn’t
wake
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
right
behind
jim’s
bed
now
,
and
we’d
dig
in
under
it
,
and
when
we
got
through
there
couldn’t
nobody
in
the
cabin
ever
know
there
was
any
hole
there
,
because
jim’s
counter-pin
hung
down
most
to
the
ground
,
and
you’d
have
to
raise
it
up
and
look
under
to
see
the
hole
.

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
was
a
good
idea
,
so
he
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
it
in
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
that
what
he
meant
was
,
we
could
steal
anything
we
needed
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
so
himself
.
|
|
|
she
was
going
to
get
one
of
us
,
sure
,
before
we
got
through
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
poked
about
amongst
the
passages
,
and
pretty
soon
ducked
under
a
wall
where
you
wouldn’t
a
noticed
that
there
was
a
hole
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
says
:
“now
,
we’ll
start
this
band
of
robbers
and
call
it
tom
sawyer’s
gang
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
it
wasn’t
enough
;
but
i
said
nobody
wouldn’t
ever
see
the
plates
that
jim
throwed
out
,
because
they’d
fall
in
the
dog-fennel
and
jimpson
weeds
under
the
window-hole—then
we
could
tote
them
back
and
he
could
use
them
over
again
.

sawyer
called
the
hogs
“ingots
,”
and
he
called
the
turnips
and
stuff
“julery
,”
and
we
would
go
to
the
cave
and
powwow
over
what
we
had
done
,
and
how
many
people
we
had
killed
and
marked
.

said
i
was
a
numskull
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
a
nigger-stealer
!
|
|
|
he
says
the
same
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
was
over
the
stile
and
starting
for
the
house
;
the
wagon
was
spinning
up
the
road
for
the
village
,
and
we
was
all
bunched
in
the
front
door
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|

|
|
|
|
|
joyful
.
|
|
in
high
spirits
.
|
|
|
|
a
good
deal
bothered
about
what
to
do
for
a
spoon
,
but
he
said
we’d
got
to
have
it
;
so
he
took
a
think
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
had
his
store
clothes
on
,
and
an
audience—and
that
was
always
nuts
for
tom
sawyer
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
and
me
was
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
and
bed
;
so
,
being
tired
,
we
bid
good-night
and
went
up
to
bed
right
after
supper
,
and
clumb
out
of
the
window
and
down
the
lightning-rod
,
and
shoved
for
the
town
;
for
i
didn’t
believe
anybody
was
going
to
give
the
king
and
the
duke
a
hint
,
and
so
if
i
didn’t
hurry
up
and
give
them
one
they’d
get
into
trouble
sure
.

jerked
the
door
open
and
flung
out
a
slab
of
jim’s
meat
,
and
the
dogs
went
for
it
,
and
in
two
seconds
he
was
out
himself
and
back
again
and
shut
the
door
,
and
i
knowed
he’d
fixed
the
other
door

most
ruined
for
a
servant
,
because
he
got
stuck
up
on
account
of
having

for
putting
our
traps
in
there
right
away
,
but
i
said
we
didn’t
want
to
be
climbing
up

down
there
all
the
time

disappointed
,

i

never

,
cairo
would
be

always
kept
that
five-center
piece
round
his
neck
with
a
string
,
and
said
it
was
a
charm
the
devil
give
to
him
with
his
own
hands
,
and
told
him
he
could
cure
anybody
with
it
and
fetch
witches
whenever
he
wanted
to
just
by
saying
something
to
it
;
but
he
never
told
what
it

he

to
it

got
out
his
hair-ball
and
said
something
over
it
,
and
then
he
held
it
up

dropped
it
on
the
floor
.

down

.

|
|
|
|

tried
it
again
,

then
another

it
acted
just
the

.

|
|
|
|
|

|
|

smelt
it

bit
it

rubbed
it
,

said
he
would
manage
so
the

would

it
was
good
.

laid
it
in
with
all

said
it

sign
it

|
|
|

|
made
him
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
to
be
so
close
to
freedom
.
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
would
take
him
a
year
to
scrabble
such
a
lot
of
truck
on
to
the
logs
with
a
nail
,
and
he
didn’t
know
how
to
make
letters
,
besides
;
but
tom
said
he
would
block
them
out
for
him
,
and
then
he
wouldn’t

nothing

just
follow

wouldn’t

but
i
didn’t
believe
that
,

i

if
we
had
the
canoe
hid
in
a
good
place
,
and
had
all
the
traps
in
the
cavern
,
we
could
rush
there
if
anybody
was

reckoned
the

widow
was
partly
right
and
pap
was
partly
right
;
so
the
best
way
would
be
for
us
to
pick
out
two
or
three
things
from
the
list
and
say
we
wouldn’t
borrow
them
any
more—then
he
reckoned
it

the
others

bet
she
did
think
of
it
by
the
time
the
men
was
ready
to
start
,
and
he
believed
they
must
a
gone
up-town
to
get
a
dog
and
so
they
lost
all
that
time
,
or
else
we
wouldn’t
be
here
on
a
towhead
sixteen
or
seventeen
mile
below
the
village—no
,
indeedy
,
we
would
be

found
so
much
fault
with
it
,

with
the
work

bother
of
raising
the
mullen
,

jews-harping
the
rats

flattering
up

of
all
the
other
work
he
had
to
do
on
pens
,
and
inscriptions
,
and
journals
,

things
,
which
made
it
more
trouble
and
worry
and
responsibility
to
be
a
prisoner
than
anything
he
ever
undertook
,
that
tom
most
lost
all
patience
with
him
;
and
said
he
was
just
loadened
down
with
more
gaudier
chances
than
a
prisoner
ever
had
in
the
world
to
make
a
name
for
himself
,
and
yet
he
didn’t
know
enough
to
appreciate
them
,
and
they
was
just
about
wasted
on
him
.

the

a
laid
them
;
well
,
that
looked
kind

reasonable
,
so
i
didn’t
say
nothing
against
it
,
because
i’ve
seen
a

throwed
some

over
him

he

to
chop
off
the
snake’s

throw
it
away
,

then
skin
the

roast
a
piece

sucked
and
sucked
at

,

now
and
then
he
got
out
of
his
head

pitched
around
and
yelled
;

every

he
come

himself
he

he

i

go
in

dark

look
sharp
.

it

it

a
fair
fit

|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
made
a
floor
for
the
wigwam
,
and
raised
it
a
foot
or
more
above
the
level
of
the
raft
,
so
now
the

all

on

so
i
tramped
off
in
a
hurry
for
the
crick
,
and
crowded
through
the
willows
,
red-hot
to
jump
aboard

he
allowed
they
was
made
,

i
allowed
they
happened
;
i
judged
it
would
have
took
too
long
to
make
so
many
.

spoke
to
the
duke

said
he
hoped
it
wouldn’t
take
but
a
few
hours
,
because
it
got
mighty
heavy
and
tiresome
to
him
when
he
had
to
lay
all
day
in
the
wigwam
tied
with
the
rope
.

couldn’t
see
no
sense
in
the
most
of
it
,
but
he
allowed
we
was
white
folks
and
knowed
better
than
him
;
so
he
was
satisfied
,
and
said
he
would
do
it
all
just
as
tom
said

let
on

what
it
was
only
just
a
piece
of
rock
or
something
like
that
that’s
always
getting
into
bread
,
you
know
;
but
after
that
he
never
bit
into
nothing
but
what
he
jabbed
his
fork
into
it
in
three
or
four
places
first
.

over
the

barked
both

right
in

we
made
a
layer
of
dirt
about
five
or
six
inches
deep
with
a
frame
around
it
for
to
hold
it
to
its

;
this
was
to
build
a
fire
on
in
sloppy
weather

chilly
;
the

would
keep

fourteen
year

,
was
riding
through
the
woods
on
t’other
side
of

didn’t
have
no
weapon
with
him
,
which
was
blame’
foolishness
,
and
in
a
lonesome
place
he
hears
a
horse
a-coming
behind
him
,
and
sees
old
baldy
shepherdson
a-linkin’
after
him
with
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
his
white
hair
a-flying
in
the
wind
;
and
‘stead
of
jumping
off
and
taking
to
the
brush
,
bud
‘lowed
he
could
out-run
him
;
so
they
had
it
,
nip
and
tuck
,
for
five
mile
or
more
,
the
old
man
a-gaining
all
the
time
;
so
at
last
bud
seen
it
warn’t
any
use
,
so
he
stopped
and
faced
around
so
as
to
have
the
bullet
holes
in
front
,
you
know
,
and
the
old
man
he
rode
up

shot
him
