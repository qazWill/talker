end nodes are labeled to indicate the end of a sentence or thought

children may be references to nodes anywhere in the tree, so if that word or phase is already somewhere
go there????

make sure links dont duplicate

add descriptions to objects with links:


similarity
	like
	synonyms
	antonyms
	

frequency
	never
	rarely
	sometimes
	often
	usually
	always

magnitude?
trustworthyness? how many sources say so?  if 10 or more treat as fact?
	
		can be a verb phrase, adjective, noun?

		for example 
		
		fish never come on land
		fish rarely come out of water
		fish sometimes make bubbles
		fish often are colorful
		fish usually eat other fish
		fish are always in some body of water
		fish sometimes big
		fish are usually tasty


maybe link to sentences too

books, quotes, memories?

when asked something unknown like what do horses eat:

	realizes info not known

	maybe try searching web?

	or:
		
	look at cousin attributes or parent attributes

	respond with guess, they are similar to ___ so maybe ___???

	maybe even look at trends like this animal eats ... ... .. and likes all three of them so maybe most animals like the things they eat

	maybe more effecient way to save 

	replace what with actual values when reading
